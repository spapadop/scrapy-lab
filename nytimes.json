{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/science/black-hole-picture.html", "title": "Darkness Visible, Finally: Astronomers Capture First Ever Image of a Black Hole", "authors": "Dennis Overbye", "contents": "Astronomers announced on Wednesday that at last they had captured an image of the unobservable: a black hole, a cosmic abyss so deep and dense that not even light can escape it.For years, and for all the mounting scientific evidence, black holes have remained marooned in the imaginations of artists and the algorithms of splashy computer models of the kind used in Christopher Nolan's outer-space epic \"Interstellar.\" Now they are more real than ever.\"We have seen what we thought was unseeable,\" said Shep Doeleman, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and director of the effort to capture the image, during a Wednesday news conference in Washington, D.C.The image, of a lopsided ring of light surrounding a dark circle deep in the heart of a galaxy known as Messier 87, some 55 million light-years away from Earth, resembled the Eye of Sauron, a reminder yet again of the implacable power of nature. It is a smoke ring framing a one-way portal to eternity.To capture the image, astronomers reached across intergalactic space to Messier 87, or M87, a giant galaxy in the constellation Virgo. There, a black hole several billion times more massive than the sun is unleashing a violent jet of energy some 5,000 light-years into space.The image offered a final, ringing affirmation of an idea so disturbing that even Einstein, from whose equations black holes emerged, was loath to accept it. If too much matter is crammed into one place, the cumulative force of gravity becomes overwhelming, and the place becomes an eternal trap. Here, according to Einstein's theory, matter, space and time come to an end and vanish like a dream.On Wednesday morning that dark vision became a visceral reality. As far as the team of astronomers could ascertain, the shape of the shadow is circular, as Einstein's theory predicts. The results were announced simultaneously at news conferences in Washington, D.C., and five other places around the world, befitting an international collaboration involving 200 members, nine telescopes and for the Astrophysical Journal Letters. When the image was put up on the screen in Washington, cheers and gasps, followed by applause, broke out in the room and throughout a universe of astrofans following the live-streamed event.Priyamvada Natarajan, an astrophysicist at Yale, said that Einstein must be delighted. \"His theory has just been stress-tested under conditions of extreme gravity, and looks to have held up.\" Kip Thorne, an astrophysicist at the California Institute of Technology, and who shared a Nobel Prize in 2017 for the discovery of gravitational waves from colliding black holes, wrote in an email: \"It is wonderful to see the nearly circular shadow of the black hole. There can be no doubt this really is a black hole at the center of M87, with no signs of deviations from general relativity.\"Janna Levin, a cosmologist and professor at Barnard College in New York, said, \"What a time to be alive.\" The image emerged from two years of computer analysis of observations from a network of radio antennas called the Event Horizon Telescope. In all, observed the galaxy in Virgo on and off for 10 days in April 2017. The telescope array also monitored a dim source of radio noise called Sagittarius A* (pronounced Sagittarius A-star), at the heart of our Milky Way galaxy. There, 26,000 light-years from Earth, and cloaked in interstellar dust and gas, lurks another black hole, with a mass of 4.1 million suns.The network is named after the edge of a black hole, the point of no return; beyond the event horizon, not even light can escape the black hole's gravitational pull.The mystery of black holes has tantalized astronomers for more than half a century. In the 1950s, astronomers with radio telescopes discovered that pearly, seemingly peaceful galaxies were spewing radio energy from their cores -- far more energy than would be produced by the ordinary thermonuclear engines that make stars shine. Perhaps, astrophysicists thought, the energy was being liberated by matter falling onto supermassive, dense objects -- later called black holes. Since then, scientists have devised detailed models of how this would work. As hot, dense gas swirls around the black hole, like water headed down a drain, the intense pressures and magnetic fields cause energy to squirt out the side. As a paradoxical result, supermassive black holes can be the most luminous objects in the universe.The images released today bolster the notion of violence perpetrated over cosmic scales, said Sera Markoff, an astrophysicist at the University of Amsterdam, and a member of the Event Horizon team. \"Black holes must be the most exotic major disrupters of cosmic order,\" she said.The unveiling today took place almost exactly a century after images of made Einstein famous and confirmed his theory of general relativity as the law of the cosmos. That theory ascribes gravity to the warping of space and time by matter and energy, much as a mattress sags under a sleeper.General relativity led to a new conception of the cosmos, in which space-time could quiver, bend, rip, expand, swirl like a mix-master and even disappear forever into the maw of a black hole.To Einstein's surprise, the equations indicated that when too much matter or energy was concentrated in one place, space-time could collapse, trapping matter and light in perpetuity. He disliked that idea, but the consensus today is that the universe is speckled with black holes furiously consuming everything around them.A planet-sized network of radio telescopes has assembled the first image of a black hole.Many are the gravitational tombstones of stars that burned up their fuel and collapsed. But others, hidden in the center of nearly every galaxy, are millions or billions of times more massive than the sun.Nobody knows how such behemoths of nothingness could have been assembled. Dense wrinkles in the primordial energies of the Big Bang? Monster runaway stars that collapsed and swallowed up their surroundings in the dawning years of the universe?Nor do scientists know what ultimately happens to whatever falls into a black hole, nor what forces reign at the center, where, theoretically, the density approaches infinity and smoke pours from nature's computer.Any lingering doubts about the reality of black holes dissolved three years ago when the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, detected through the fabric of space-time.Now the reality has a face. Peter Galison, a physicist, filmmaker and historian at Harvard, and a member of the Event Horizon team, noted that there is \"a wonderful open-ended sense of being able to see something\" instead of merely accumulating statistical evidence.Still, questions about gravity and the universe abound. \"We know there must be something more,\" Avery Broderick, a physicist at the University of Waterloo, in Ontario, told the audience in Washington, D.C. \"Black holes are one of the places to look for answers.\"Proving that the monsters in Virgo and the center of the Milky Way were really black holes required measuring the sizes of their shadows. That was no easy job. Both look exceedingly small from this distance, and resolving their tiny details would be a challenge for even the biggest individual telescope. Moreover, the view is blurred by the charged particles such as electrons and protons that fill interstellar space. \"It's like looking through frosted glass,\" said Dr. Doeleman, director of the Event Horizon Telescope.To see into the shadows, astronomers needed to be able to tune their radio telescope to shorter wavelengths. And they needed a bigger telescope.Enter the Event Horizon Telescope, the dream child of Dr. Doeleman. By combining data from radio telescopes as far apart as the South Pole, France, Chile and Hawaii, using a technique called very long baseline interferometry, Dr. Doeleman and his colleagues created a telescope as big as Earth itself, with the power to resolve details as small as an orange on the lunar surface.In April 2017, the network of eight telescopes, including the South Pole Telescope, synchronized by atomic clocks, stared at the two targets off and on for 10 days.For two years, the Event Horizon team reduced and collated the results. The data were too voluminous to transmit over the internet, so they were placed on hard disks and flown back to M.I.T.'s , in Westford, Mass., and the , in Bonn, Germany.The data from the South Pole could not arrive before December 2017, Dr. Doeleman said in an interview, \"because it was Antarctic winter, when nothing could go in or out.\"Last year the team divided into four groups to assemble images from the data dump. To stay objective and guard against bias, the teams had no contact with each other. They readied themselves for an inconclusive or ambiguous result -- a blur, perhaps, that they couldn't quite read.Dr. Doeleman grew optimistic last year at a dinner attended by some of the younger members of the team, who showed him the first data for M87. \"There were clear signatures of a ringlike structure,\" he said. After dinner, he went to his office and made some crude calculations. \"That was one of those great moments,\" he said. \"It was a surprise how clear this image is.\"As matter swirls into a black hole, it accretes into a disk just outside the abyss's edge. The ring of light in the new image corresponds to the innermost orbit of photons, the quantum particles that make up light. By laying a ruler across that ring, astronomers could measure the size of the black hole and see that it met Einstein's prescription. The measurement also gave a firm estimate of the mass of the Virgo black hole: 6.5 billion solar masses. That is heavier than most previous determinations, and it suggests that the masses of other big black holes may need to be revised upward. The observations also revealed that the accretion disk -- the doughnut of doom -- is on its side with regard to Earth, the hole facing us and spinning clockwise. The image is brighter where gas flows around the hole, toward us.Dr. Doeleman described the black hole in the center of the Milky Way as \"a fascinating, interesting object.\" But it is much smaller than the Virgo black hole, so its portrait is harder to capture. That task lies ahead for the Event Horizon Telescope.The telescope network continues to grow. In April 2018, a telescope in Greenland was added to the collaboration. Another observation run was made of the Milky Way and M87, and captured twice the amount of data gathered in 2017. That data was not part of the results released today, but will be used to confirm them and monitor the behavior of the black holes. Two more antennas are waiting to join the Event Horizon Telescope.\"The plan is to carry out these observations indefinitely and see how things change,\" said Dr. Doeleman, embarking on his new career as a tamer of extragalactic beasts.\"It's astonishing to think humans can turn the Earth into a telescope and see a black hole,\" and still more amazing to do it with this team, he said. \"That's the best.\""},
{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/opinion/game-of-thrones.html", "title": "Why We Need 'Game of Thrones'", "authors": "", "contents": "\"Game of Thrones\" returns on Sunday, and with it, the inevitable onslaught of \"winter is finally here\" memes and a sudden obsession with dragons, knights and internecine feudal politics. But the show isn't just warmed-over fantasy tropes. Its conflicts have become part of our public discourse, and Westeros, its fictional kingdom, has become an allegory for America.This isn't the first time a medieval fantasy has served this purpose. \"Lord of the Rings\" grew out of J.R.R. Tolkien's traumatic experiences as a soldier in World War I. It achieved widespread popularity in the United States during the 1960s and '70s, when hippies joked about electing the wise wizard Gandalf as president and wore \"Frodo Lives!\" buttons, an emblem of their solidarity with the idyllic, communal life of the Shire. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the massive multiplayer game \"World of Warcraft\" dominated the global gaming market. Its story of war between the orc-led Horde and human-led Alliance was set in an immersive, intricately detailed medieval fantasy world. J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels, in which the young heroes battle an evil wizard who perverts democracy, climbed the best-seller lists during the same period. Magic rules all of these realms, reducing complex social and political conflicts to battles over spells and ensorcellment.Whenever there's trouble in the land, it seems, our narrative appetites lead us backward in time, offering escape in tales of a world before modern statehood and techno-capitalism. But escapism isn't just a flight from reality. Ursula Le Guin, the celebrated fantasy author, once asked, \"If a soldier is imprisoned by the enemy, don't we consider it his duty to escape?\" She was writing about Tolkien, arguing that escapism in all its forms is a survival strategy, a way to think ourselves out of traps. In Ms. Le Guin's Earthsea novels, wizards craft magic out of words, trying to prevent a creeping global sickness by, in essence, telling the right story. If we think of fantasy as a way to escape from a dark fate, \"Game of Thrones\" is a skeleton key. In that case, what is the prison? And why does the path always seem to lead through the Middle Ages? One possible answer is that \"Game of Thrones\" is not actually about the past at all. It fits within a long tradition of books suggesting that our planet's distant future might look a lot like the distant past. This idea goes back generations. In Edgar Rice Burroughs's pulpy 1912 novella \"A Princess of Mars,\" a medieval Martian civilization is all that remains of a previously hyper-advanced, technologically sophisticated world. Jack Vance's wildly popular 1950s series \"Dying Earth\" imagined an earth so old that its sun is fading, the moon is gone and magic rules. More recently, David Mitchell's \"Cloud Atlas\" and N.K. Jemisin's \"Broken Earth\" trilogy hint that the far future might look very much like ancient history. Both authors describe worlds in which people have returned to Neolithic or medieval ways of life, largely because their civilizations have made catastrophic political and environmental mistakes.It isn't easy to imagine our distant future without fiction. We have computer models to forecast what centuries of climate change might do to the earth, and some vague notions of how this might transform our social and economic systems. But when the crisis at hand is about elections and economic recessions, it's hard to make decisions that take that faraway world into account. Perhaps \"Game of Thrones\" functions as a cultural reset button, inviting us to imagine how we might redo nationhood and industrialism if we had the chance. What if we could enter the modern era again, and do it right this time? Maybe this time, enlightened despots won't grind up the peasants in an endless war.That's why pseudo-historical stories are, oddly, the keys to thinking about what comes next for planet earth. Will our fortified border walls be all that remains after climate disaster? Or will we finally put aside political rivalries to save ourselves? We can explore our options while acknowledging the likelihood that we'll make mistakes.\"Game of Thrones\" feels relevant now, not simply because it allows us to speculate about which terrible real-life leader most resembles the sadistic King Joffrey, or see how climate change can blight the land with supernatural force. Like other medieval tales, \"Game of Thrones\" is not a precise allegory. Instead, it slakes our thirst for narratives that remind us that humanity will have a distant future, in whatever form it takes. We are building it right now.In the near future, as we face the increasing likelihood of catastrophe, we need to unleash our imagination. We will need it to find the escape route.

She's scored 184 of them after all, the most by any soccer player, male or female, in international soccer history. But now, a few years into her retirement, Wambach, who led the United States women's team to a World Cup championship in 2015, is focused on a new kind of goal: motivating women to become leaders. \"There has never been a more important, urgent time than right now for women to begin to fully lead our own lives,\" she told me this week.In her new book, \"Wolfpack,\" Wambach, 38, shares lessons she learned from decades of training, failure and triumph on the field. It is based on the she gave at Barnard College in New York last year that quickly went viral. \"If I could go back and tell my younger self one thing, it would be this: 'Abby, you were never Little Red Riding Hood; you were always the wolf,'\" she told graduates.Her book's release comes a month after the United States women's team filed a against the United States Soccer Federation. While Wambach is not part of the suit, she's been outspoken on the subject. \"This isn't just a female athlete's story; this is every single woman's story on planet Earth,\" . \"Women lose our very lives because of this pay gap inequity, and in order to get it back we have to fight.\"In \"Wolfpack,\" Wambach offers eight new rules to help women succeed professionally and personally. And she hopes her ideas trigger a domino effect. \"When one person stands up and demands the ball, the job, the promotion, the paycheck, the microphone, that one gives others permission to do the same,\" she said. Here are the four of her \"new rules,\" and the norms she hopes they'll upend. ______\"Power and success and joy are not pies,\" Wambach writes. \"A bigger slice for one woman doesn't mean a smaller slice for another.\"______\"I was so grateful for a paycheck, so grateful to represent my country, so grateful to be the token woman at the table, so grateful to receive any respect at all that I was afraid to use my voice to demand more,\" Wambach writes. \"Our gratitude is how power uses the tokenism of a few women to keep the rest of us in line.\"______\"Imperfect men have been empowered and permitted to run the world since the beginning of time,\" Wambach writes. \"It's time for imperfect women to grant themselves permission to join them.\"______\"The picture of leadership is not just a man at the head of a table,\" Wambach writes. \"It's also every woman who is allowing her own voice to guide her life and the lives of those she cares about.\"______From our Opinion pages: Women in Honduras are being killed in newly sadistic ways, sending people running for the border. [] Wikipedia isn't officially a social network, but the harassment can get ugly.

[] Jessica Pels, Cosmopolitan's new editor, is trying to save the magazine from the jaws of Instagram. []Joan E. Biren helped build a movement for their liberation. []______What would happen if women gained the same physical strength as men? That was the question posed in an in The New York Times titled \"Muscular Women\" (!). The answer, according to the opponents of equal rights at the time, would be a disruption of the natural order of things, meaning women would exert their strength to take down men physically and mentally. Should women continue to get fit, they \"must expect no favorite and no mercy,\" according to the article, because chivalry works only if women are weaker. \"If this sort of thing goes on,\" the article said, \"it's hard to say what will become of the men.\""},

Shear, Sydney Ember", "contents": "SAN ANTONIO -- President Trump used the backdrop of a Texas fund-raiser on Wednesday to warn of the dangers and tragedy of migrants flowing across the Mexican border -- an issue he predicted would play well for him in his 2020 re-election campaign.With high-dollar donors standing behind him, Mr. Trump said migrants pouring across the southwestern border were dying in great numbers while gang members arriving from Central America were marauding and threatening American ranchers. And he made clear that he was going to try to put the blame on Democrats.\"I think they're going to pay a very big price in 2020,\" Mr. Trump said here, before heading to Houston for another fund-raiser. \"I think the border is going to be an incredible issue. And they're on the wrong side. They want to have open borders.\"But Julian Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and a Democratic candidate for president, fired back at Mr. Trump, accusing him of using such talk as a political tool to energize his voters with dark threats about immigrants.\"It was predictable that he would start beating the drum of this again as he gets closer to re-election,\" Mr. Castro said in an interview. \"What I've noticed is that any time he gets into political hot water, he goes back to the issue of immigration to drum up support.\"Mr. Castro, who served as housing secretary in the Obama administration, is uniquely positioned to take on Mr. Trump on the immigration issue. The grandson of a Mexican immigrant, he is the only Latino candidate in the race for the Democratic nomination.As the sun set Wednesday evening, Mr. Castro held an immigration-focused rally of his own in San Antonio. His campaign had billed the event as an opportunity for the city, with its significant Mexican-American population, to show its resistance to Mr. Trump's immigration policy.Before a modest crowd, Mr. Castro denounced Mr. Trump's anti-immigrant message in no uncertain terms, calling the president's policies \"downright stupid.\"\"When it comes to immigration,\" Mr. Castro said, \"this president and his policies have been an absolute failure for our country.\"The president's decision to weigh in on the border was a clear signal that he did not intend to let the issue fade. At the fund-raiser, he told reporters that he wanted to call attention to a situation that he said has been ignored in the news media: the plight of migrants who cross illegally into the United States and then die of thirst or hunger.\"This doesn't come out in the fake news,\" Mr. Trump said as he recounted the stories about migrants that about a dozen donors told him. At Mr. Trump's urging, several of the donors described finding the bodies of migrants -- including pregnant women and children -- in the vast brush of their property.The president said he had never heard such stories of migrants dying, even from his top immigration and border patrol officials. In fact, immigrant advocates have for years documented the grim fate of some migrants who grow sick and die trying to make it into the United States. The advocates say Mr. Trump's policies have made the problem worse by limiting the number of migrants who can legally claim asylum at ports of entry, pushing more to cross at remote areas of the border.Several of the donors also told of how afraid they had felt when migrants from Central America, dressed in black, turned up at their homes.\"Dangerous people are coming here, and the good people are dying,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that the donors had all told him that the answer to the problem was to build the wall that has become the symbol of his approach to immigration.The president, who was joined at the round table with donors by Brad Parscale, his 2020 campaign manager, denied that the unscheduled remarks to reporters about the border were part of a campaign message. But immigration and border security has been a defining issue of his presidency. And Mr. Trump is betting that portraying the crisis that he says now exists on the Mexican border will be just as effective in his re-election campaign as the issue was in 2016.In the past several days, , his homeland security secretary, and for being too timid about shutting down the border and changing asylum rules to deny entry to migrants seeking protection in the United States.One of those officials, Ronald D. Vitiello, the acting chief of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, resigned on Wednesday after Mr. Trump pulled back his nomination for the permanent position, saying he wanted someone tougher. In a statement issued on her last day in office, Ms. Nielsen called Mr. Vitiello \"an unwavering advocate for the dedicated men and women who enforce our immigration laws.\"A top administration official said Tuesday that the staffing changes were meant to make way for more aggressive immigration actions..]But the president faces challenges of his own. His campaign promises have mostly gone unfulfilled. He has to build the along the southwestern border . And the recent surge of migrant families from Central America is a vivid demonstration of his inability to stop what he has called an \"invasion.\"There was also significant evidence during the 2018 midterm elections that the president's immigration attacks backfired in some Republican districts around the country. For example, several House Republicans, including some of the party's leaders in Congress, complained to Mr. Trump that his announcement right before the election that he was considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship might have cost several moderate Republicans their seats.And as he sets out for the re-election campaign, Mr. Trump is certain to face several challengers among the Democrats who are determined to make the president's immigration agenda a key part of their reason for running. In February, Beto O'Rourke, a former congressman from El Paso who has since declared his own candidacy for president, outlined his opposition to Mr. Trump's immigration policies at a rally held at the same time the president spoke in that Texas border city.\"We are not safe because of walls but in spite of walls,\" Mr. O'Rourke told supporters even as Mr. Trump was pressing to \"finish the wall.\"The dual candidacies of Mr. Castro and Mr. O'Rourke are almost certain to place Texas squarely at the center of the increasingly heated immigration debate.\"Texas is a Latino state, and we have two Texans on the ballot who are going to be turning out and galvanizing people from Texas,\" said Mayra Macias, a vice president of the Latino Victory Project. \"But it's also helping galvanize people, Latinos in particular, across the country because they are seeing these candidates talk about issues that affect us.\"But if immigration is at once a key campaign issue in Texas and other states, including California and Arizona, Republicans are betting that Mr. Trump's anti-immigrant message will also resonate far from the border."},

They agreed, however, to review the arrangement at the end of June to prevent British disruption to the bloc while the nation remains in Europe's departure lounge.Although the intense pressure of recent weeks may abate for now, the path ahead still resembles a minefield, dotted with explosive issues like a possible attempt to topple Mrs. May, a general election or a second Brexit referendum -- or some combination of the three. Most immediately, Mrs. May is likely to face calls to step down, and potential successors are already trying to raise money and advertise their credentials.At a news conference, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said that the two sides had agreed to what he called \"a flexible extension\" until Oct. 31, adding that this provided an \"additional six months for the U.K. to find the best possible solution.\" In essence, the bloc agreed to kick the Brexit can down the road for another six months.Mr. Tusk said that the Oct. 31 date was \"a bit shorter than I expected,\" but said that the extension should be enough to complete Brexit if London showed \"good will.\" He told the British: \"Please do not waste this time.\"But he did not rule out another extension. The June review, he said, was not for negotiation, but only to inform member states about the state of play in Britain.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker dismissed worries that Britain would interfere in the work of the bloc, saying that Britain's being \"a difficult partner\" was \"nothing new.\"Mrs. May said she knew that there was \"huge frustration\" at home that she had needed to request the extension. She appealed to lawmakers to support a Brexit agreement, adding that \"the choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear.\"But she can expect fierce criticism later on Thursday from her own lawmakers, many of whom opposed delaying Brexit to June, let alone October. Reminded of statements that she would not contemplate remaining in the bloc beyond June, Mrs. May said that the agreement allowed Britain to leave by then if Parliament approved a deal.The extension means that Britain will almost certainly have to hold elections for the European Parliament on May 23, something Mrs. May once argued would be absurd, almost three years after Britons voted for withdrawal. That prospect seems certain to anger hard-line Brexit supporters.President Emmanuel Macron of France called the October date \"the best compromise\" to maintain European unity. It's now \"up to Britons to be clear with themselves and their people,\" he said, about whether they want to participate in the European Parliament elections next month even though they would have to abandon the legislature a few months later.This was . Originally, she had promised Britons that she would strike a deal by March 29, only to acknowledge last month that the goal was impossible. Having missed that deadline, Mrs. May was a supplicant to the 27 other leaders of the bloc, who made their latest decision after she had left the room.Having lost control of the process in Brussels, Mrs. May will return to a pitched battle with pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers, including a significant number who now want her out and seem willing to risk an economically damaging departure without an agreement.Some have been arguing that Britain should use an extension to from the inside. While Mrs. May has promised not to do so, her position is so shaky that thoughts are turning to how a successor might behave, particularly a pro-Brexit hard-liner like Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary.At the same time, if Britain's Parliament should finally pass the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the bloc, then Brexit would take place on the first of the next month.European nations had been divided between those who wanted a shorter extension, to keep up pressure on Britain to resolve Brexit, and those who wanted to give it the time and space to reach a sensible conclusion.On Wednesday it was Mr. Macron who took the toughest line, arguing that Britain needed to propose a credible plan to resolve the crisis.On his insistence, plans to give Britain as much as another year were scrapped in favor of a shorter delay. He had argued that a long extension risked disrupting the bloc's more important work and that Britain's political confusion could prove contagious.But there was never any question of slamming the door instantly on Britain and triggering a disruptive \"no-deal\" Brexit that would have occurred Friday night in the absence of an extension. And Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany stressed the need for Britain to have time to manage an orderly process, which would allow for a good relationship between the two sides after the divorce.The October deadline was therefore a compromise, chosen in part because it would keep Britain outside the new European Commission, which will be formed in the fall.So far, the British Parliament has shown little indication that it will ever approve the withdrawal deal that Mrs. May negotiated with the European Union. That is a legally binding treaty that would resolve technical issues, like the government's outstanding financial commitments to the bloc, and keep Britain inside its economic structures until at least December 2020.After that point, Mrs. May wants to detach Britain from Europe's customs union and single market, and to take control of immigration from the Continent.That formula has been in Parliament and, despite with the opposition Labour Party, prospects for its passage still look low.More talks between the parties were scheduled for Thursday, but Labour has complained that Mrs. May has shown no sign of budging from her basic goal of taking Britain out of a customs union with the bloc.Were she to accept staying in a customs union, which is Labour's bedrock position, that would preclude Britain from forging trade deals on its own, defeating, in the minds of pro-Brexit lawmakers, the entire purpose of Brexit. Such a step would risk cabinet resignations and enrage the party faithful.In the coming weeks there may be more votes in Parliament to gauge opinion on various approaches to Brexit, but the possibility of assembling a sustainable majority for any one blueprint still seems remote.Conservative Brexit supporters are hoping they can replace Mrs. May with a hard-liner who could reopen the withdrawal agreement painfully negotiated over months with the European Union.But European officials emphasize that the withdrawal agreement, including a provision known as designed to guarantee no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, will not change. If Britain wants a managed Brexit, it must pass the withdrawal agreement first, they say: Only then can the European Union begin negotiations on a future relationship."},

Nobody can take that away from Benjamin Netanyahu. This summer, in his fifth term, he will surpass David Ben-Gurion as the longest-serving Israeli prime minister. Enough said.His victory contains a warning for any Democrat still imagining that the 2020 election will bring an easy victory over Donald Trump. The Netanyahu playbook will be President Trump's next year. Gather nationalist and religious voters in your camp, add in a strong economy, dose with fear, sprinkle with strongman appeal, inject a dash of racism and victory is yours -- whatever indictments are looming.It's not that this happen. It happen, absent some decisive factor to upend the logic of it. Netanyahu is savvier than Trump, but they share a shrewd assessment of how to control and manipulate the politics of spectacle, as well as a fierce determination to stay out of jail. They campaign ugly.Exactly a century ago, Ben-Gurion said, \"Everyone sees the difficulty of relations between Jews and Arabs, but not everyone sees there is no solution to that question.\" Netanyahu's solution is by now clear. He is a true believer in Greater Israel and will not give up one inch of the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River. There will be no Palestinian state on his watch. Period.Many Israelis, weary of the chimera of a two-state peace, thank him for that -- as they thank him for a strong economy, Trump's support and a sense of stability. Netanyahu is a formidable politician adept in using hate and fear, the strongest currency in contemporary politics.His victory was personal but it was also structural. Israel now has a structural majority of the right. This will almost certainly enable Netanyahu to form a right-wing government, even though his Likud party appeared tied with the Blue and White party of his upstart challenger, Benny Gantz, each winning 35 seats.The Gantz performance was remarkable. It demonstrated the deep disquiet of liberal Israel over Netanyahu the King. But in the end Gantz took more votes from the left -- the Labor Party and Meretz -- than from the right. As Avi Scharf, editor of the English edition of the liberal daily Haaretz, put it to me, \"Israel's founding left is totally obliterated.\"The structural majority of the right is composed of the ultra-Orthodox, the settler movement, Mizrahi Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent, nationalists of various stripes and Russian immigrants like the one who recently told my friend Shlomo Avineri, a political scientist, \"I don't want to live under Putin, but I want my leader to be like Putin.\"Netanyahu never passes up a photo-op with Vladimir Putin, any more than he does with Trump. \"A different league,\" one of his campaign ads said. Netanyahu was able to project presence among the superpowers. His base loved it. Trump's base loves him, unswervingly. The president is not structurally assured of victory in 2020, but he is structurally within sight of it.That Netanyahu is facing indictment on bribery and other charges proved no obstacle to Likud increasing its seats to 35 from 30 in 2015. In the near term, Israeli politics -- and its democracy -- will hinge on Netanyahu's attempts to secure immunity from prosecution while in office. He may make acquiescence to such legislation a condition for coalition partners joining the government. It will not be pretty.\"We could see a coup d'etat against democracy, something very dangerous,\" Tom Segev, a prominent historian, told me.For now, Israelis seem prepared to shrug. The not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper conclusion to the Mueller report reinforced a feeling that the cloud of corruption that has hung around Netanyahu for years should not be taken as proof of it.In the longer term, Israeli politics will turn to the question of annexation. At the last minute, to shore up the right, Netanyahu promised to start annexing the West Bank if he won another term. The United Right and other extreme parties will not let him forget it.Still, there is no reason to take Netanyahu at his word. He made himself kosher with the Obama administration through his Bar Ilan speech of a decade ago supporting a Palestinian state, only to do nothing to favor one and everything to block one.Annexation could see the same fate because it's problematic. Netanyahu is happiest in the gray zone where Israel controls millions of Palestinians without having to confront the question of whether they vote or are granted Israeli citizenship. He does not want to jeopardize good relations with Egypt and the Saudis. He's quite happy with a Palestinian Authority in the West Bank that once saw itself in the role of leading the way to a Palestinian state but has become the feeble enabler of Israel's gray-zone domination.Netanyahu's annexation decision may hinge in the end on the long-incubated Trump plan for Israel-Palestine. It's said to exist. Maybe it really does. God knows. The fact that strong pushback from the United States on partial annexation is no longer assured says it all: The rightist nationalist wave has yet to crest."},

Vogel", "contents": "WASHINGTON -- Lawyers for Gregory B. Craig, a White House counsel in the Obama administration, expect him to be indicted in the coming days on charges related to his work for the Russia-aligned government of Ukraine.The case against Mr. Craig, 74, stemmed from an initiated by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.An Ivy League-educated lawyer who held prominent positions in the Clinton and Obama administrations, Mr. Craig would become the first person who made his name in Democratic Party politics to be charged in a case linked to the special counsel's investigation.Mr. Craig would also become the first person to be charged in a case connected to the special counsel after Mr. Mueller finished his investigation into the 2016 presidential election. In a summary of the inquiry, Attorney General William P. Barr said that the special counsel's team had concluded that President Trump or his aides \"conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\"The case against Mr. Craig is related to the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, which the Justice Department is in part because of scrutiny related to Mr. Mueller's investigation.The law requires Americans to disclose detailed information about lobbying and public relations work for foreign governments and politicians, and it has been the basis for brought against investigated by the special counsel.Mr. Craig's lawyers do not necessarily expect him to be charged with violating the act.Rather, they expect him to be charged with making false statements to the Justice Department officials examining whether he was required to register under the law for work he did in 2012, while he was a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.The work, on behalf of the government of Viktor F. Yanukovych, then the president of Ukraine, was linked to Paul Manafort, who at the time was a political consultant earning tens of millions of dollars for his representation of Mr. Yanukovych.Mr. Manafort, who went on to become Mr. Trump's campaign chairman in 2016, was sentenced last month on charges brought by Mr. Mueller's team related to obstruction of justice and violations of FARA, as well as banking and tax laws stemming from his work in Ukraine.Mr. Manafort arranged for Skadden Arps to be paid more than $5.2 million in 2012 and 2013, primarily from a Ukrainian oligarch, to assist the Ukrainian Justice Ministry. Specifically, Mr. Craig and his team produced a report that Mr. Manafort intended to use to quell Western criticism of the prosecution and jailing by Mr. Yanukovych's government of one of his rivals, the former prime minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko, and to train Ukrainian prosecutors handling matters related to the case.After the report was released, and Mr. Craig was quoted discussing it in an , the Justice Department unit that oversees FARA reached out to Skadden Arps to ask why the firm and its lawyers had not registered as foreign agents for the Ukrainian government.The department initially concluded in 2013 that Skadden Arps was obligated to register. But it reversed itself the next year after Mr. Craig made the case that the law did not apply to his work on behalf of Ukraine.After the initial determination, Mr. Craig told the Justice Department that he and Skadden Arps did not proactively reach out to news outlets to disseminate and promote the report. Rather, he claimed he distributed the report only \"in response to requests from the media,\" according to a letter he sent to the department at the time.Prosecutors cast doubt on Mr. Craig's claim in a in January between the Justice Department and Skadden Arps. Under that settlement, the firm avoided prosecution in the matter in exchange for an agreement to pay $4.6 million, to retroactively register its Ukraine work under FARA, to beef up its compliance processes and to cooperate with government investigations of the work on behalf of Ukraine.But the settlement did not exonerate Mr. Craig, and in fact it signaled that he was in prosecutors' cross hairs. It quoted emails showing Mr. Craig reached out to a journalist to offer to provide the report and discuss it.Neither Mr. Craig nor the journalist are identified by name in the settlement. The journalist, David E. Sanger of The New York Times, is an author of .Mr. Craig's lawyers have argued that he was not required to register his work under FARA because he was not doing public relations for the Ukrainian government.In a statement on Wednesday, they said he \"repeatedly refused requests that he participate in Ukraine's media and lobbying campaign to promote the Tymoshenko Report.\"Rather, they say he spoke to The Times to correct the Ukrainian Justice Ministry's claims that the report cleared Mr. Yanukovych of accusations that he directed the prosecution of Ms. Tymoshenko for political purposes.The report \"was critical of the Tymoshenko trial and caused unhappiness in the Ministry of Justice,\" the lawyers said in their statement.Mr. Craig's lawyers asserted that the case against their client was flimsy, pointing out that Mr. Mueller's team to federal prosecutors in Manhattan last year for potential prosecution related to FARA, but that they did not bring charges. Instead, the case was .It is being handled by the United States attorney's office in Washington, and the Justice Department's National Security Division, which enforces FARA.Mr. Craig's lawyers said in the statement, \"We expect an indictment by the D.C. U.S. attorney's office at the request of the National Security Division.\" But they added, \"Mr. Craig is not guilty of any charge and the government's stubborn insistence on prosecuting Mr. Craig is a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion.\"Mr. Craig left Skadden Arps last year as scrutiny of his work with Mr. Manafort escalated and after a former associate of the firm to lying to investigators about his work on the effort."},

Shear, Miriam Jordan, Manny Fernandez", "contents": "[]SAN YSIDRO, Calif. -- It was never like this before.The migrants come now in the middle of the night or in the bright light of day. Men and women arrive by the hundreds, caked with dirt, with teens and toddlers in tow. They jump the small fences in remote parts of Texas, and they gather on the hot pavement at the main border crossing in California. Tired and fearful, they look for the one thing that they pray will allow them to stay in the United States, at least for a while: a Border Patrol agent.Gone are the days when young, strong men waited on the Tijuana River levees for their chance to wade across the water, evade capture and find work for the summer. These days, thousands of people a day simply walk up to the border and surrender. Most of them are from Central America, seeking to escape from gang violence, sexual abuse, death threats and persistent poverty. The smugglers have told them they will be quickly released, as long as they bring a child, and that they will be allowed to remain in the United States for years while they pursue their asylum cases.The very nature of immigration to America changed after 2014, when families first began showing up in large numbers. The resulting crisis has overwhelmed a system unable to detain, care for and quickly decide the fate of tens of thousands of people who claim to be fleeing for their lives. For years, both political parties have tried -- and failed -- to overhaul the nation's immigration laws, mindful that someday the government would reach a breaking point.That moment has arrived. The country is now unable to provide either the necessary humanitarian relief for desperate migrants or even basic controls on the number and nature of who is entering the United States.The immigration courts now have more than 800,000 pending cases; each one takes an average of 700 days to process. And because laws and court rulings aimed at protecting children prohibit jailing young people for more than 20 days, families are often simply released. They are dropped off at downtown bus stations in places like Brownsville, Tex., where dozens last week sat on gray metal benches, most without money or even laces on their shoes, heading for destinations across the United States.At the current pace of nearly 100,000 migrants each month, officials say more than a million people will have tried to cross the border in a 12-month period. Some of those arriving today will have a strong legal case to stay under international refugee treaties and federal asylum laws, but most won't have a formal asylum hearing until 2021.The flow of migrant families has reached record levels, with February totals 560 percent above those for the same period last year. As many as 27,000 children are expected to cross the border and enter the immigration enforcement system in April alone. So crowded are border facilities that some of the nearly 3,500 migrants in custody in El Paso under a bridge, behind razor wire.In recent days, officials have grasped for ever-more-dire ways to describe the situation: \"operational emergency\"; \"unsustainable\"; \"systemwide meltdown.\"One top official said simply: \"The system is on fire.\"For President Trump, the situation at the border has generated red-hot fury. It erupted again on Sunday as he abruptly forced out Kirstjen Nielsen, his long-embattled homeland security secretary, for what he considered her failure to put an end to the surge of migrants.In recent days, the president has landed on a dark new message that, if taken literally, could mean an end to all immigration -- legal and illegal -- across the Mexican border. \"The system is full,\" the president said in California on Friday, standing in front of the rusting iron slats of the border wall that he wants to expand for hundreds of miles across the country's southern border. \"Whether it's asylum, whether it's anything you want, it's illegal immigration. We can't take you anymore.\"Yet, perversely, the president's own anti-immigrant rhetoric has helped supercharge the pipeline of migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Smugglers lately have been buying radio ads in Central America, warning that Mr. Trump is about to shut down all immigration. If you ever want to go to the United States, they say, go now! \"They said they would take us by bus. We would be safe,\" said Jeremias Pascoal, 16, who crossed into Texas earlier this month after paying $3,200 for a \"guide\" who showed his group to a road where he said they could surrender to the Border Patrol. Experts say the president is not wrong when he says that \"legal loopholes\" in America's immigration system are partly responsible for encouraging migrants to bring children like Jeremias on a dangerous journey that in some cases ends in tragedy. In December, in Customs and Border Protection custody after becoming gravely ill during their trip. Officials warn that .Christopher Cabrera, a vice president of the local union of Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas, pulled out his phone last week and scrolled through dozens of pictures he has taken out in the field: Groups of more than 100 people turning themselves in at night; seriously ill children huddled on the ground, being given medical aid.\"The majority of our agents get sick. Infectious disease is everywhere,\" Mr. Cabrera said, including in the Border Patrol's migrant processing center. \"There's always scabies in there. Usually we have chickenpox. We have tuberculosis in there. You name it, it's probably been through that building. So it's dangerous. It's dangerous for our agents. It's dangerous for the detainees that don't have anything.\"But the president has not chosen to prioritize a surge of new resources to the border, which could help ease the overcrowding and suffering that have gripped the migrants and the border communities where they arrive. Instead, Mr. Trump has insisted on simply trying to stop people from getting into the country in the first place -- a policy of deterrence that not only has failed but has made the problem worse.In an effort to send a \"you're not welcome\" message, the administration has tried a series of strategies: prosecuting everyone who crosses illegally, taking their children from them, tightening asylum standards, slowing down the number of people allowed to apply for asylum each day, forcing asylum applicants to remain in Mexico while they wait for court dates. In some cases, this approach has proved too cruel for the American public to tolerate and has run up against the protections enshrined in the Constitution, which the courts have decided protect migrants as well as citizens. Some of the president's agenda has been blocked by Congress or the courts. None of it has fixed the problem.To the contrary, these policies have from well-staffed border stations like the one in San Ysidro, Calif., where agents deliberately slowed down the number of migrants they would allow to cross each day, toward remote areas of West Texas and New Mexico, where the two migrant children died in December.And the administration has done little to speed up the immigration courts, though that could be just the deterrent the president has sought.\"The backlog has been allowed to build to the point of a crisis,\" said Doris Meissner, the immigration commissioner in the Clinton administration and now a fellow at the Migration Policy Institute. \"They do not accept the basic proposition that this is a population where there are people qualified for protection and that enabling the systems we have is an answer.\"In a series of international human rights agreements, beginning with the , nations agreed to allow anyone to seek asylum, even if they entered a country illegally. The agreements defined a refugee as someone with a well-founded fear of persecution based on \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" Determining whether an applicant receives asylum was left up to individual nations, but in the United States, the international obligations and the standards for asylum were largely incorporated into American immigration law beginning with the Refugee Act of 1980.Only about 20 percent of asylum seekers ultimately win the right to live and work in the United States by proving that they would face persecution in their home countries. Just wanting a better job doesn't qualify. Applicants have the burden to show evidence of past persecution or compelling testimony that establishes the \"well-founded\" fear that they would face danger if they return home.Some have won asylum, for example, by proving that their membership in a religious minority singles them out for harassment or threats. In the past, women suffering domestic abuse have qualified, as have some victims targeted by gangs. Generalized fear of violence does not qualify. Neither does poverty.Southwestern border apprehensions are on the rise after years of decline.A growing share of border crossers are from countries in Central America.100,000 apprehensionsper month on average100%OtherMexico48,672on average overthe last 12 monthsEl SalvadorHondurasGuatemalaOctober 2006March 20192007 fiscal year2018This year, a majority of them are children and individuals crossing with relatives.Many are seeking asylum, adding to the sharp rise in cases in recent years.100%200,000 asylum casesOther161,005Unaccompanied childrenIndividuals crossingin family units2013 fiscal year20192008 fiscal year2018Southwestern border apprehensions are on the rise after years of decline.100,000 apprehensionsper month on average48,672on average overthe last 12 monthsOctober 2006March 2019A growing share of border crossers are from countries in Central America.100%OtherMexicoEl SalvadorHondurasGuatemala2007 fiscal year2018This year, a majority of them are children and individuals crossing with relatives.100%OtherUnaccompanied childrenIndividuals crossingin family units2013 fiscal year2019Many are seeking asylum, adding to the sharp rise in cases in recent years.200,000 asylum cases161,0052008 fiscal year2018Sources: U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Department of Justice. | Note: Apprehensions are shown as a 12-month rolling average.By Denise LuThe asylum process begins with a \"credible fear\" screening to see if an applicant is likely to succeed in the first place.Out of nearly 100,000 credible fear interviews during the year that ended in September of 2018, an asylum officer confirmed a credible fear 74,677 times -- a nearly 75 percent approval rate. A senior Trump administration official vowed on Tuesday to dramatically reduce that rate by making the standards tougher. But it is what happens after the credible fear interview that is at the heart of America's bitter immigration debate.In 2017, 11,292 immigrants who had been released on bond or on their own recognizance were ordered deported because they failed to show up for their immigration proceedings, a 26 percent increase over the previous year, according to . Blanca Vasquez, who fled Honduras after gangs killed her husband and torched their home, passed a credible fear interview at the border in 2013. She was released and settled in northern Texas, where she got a janitorial job and waited for her day in court. About a year later, she said, she unintentionally missed her first hearing and was most likely ordered deported for failing to appear.She's not sure, because she stopped going to court at all. \"I got confused,\" she said. \"I ask God to look after me. There are too many problems in my country; I want to stay here.\"Maria Perez, a Honduran who joined a caravan with her 8-year-old son, Yunior, in November, waited two months in Tijuana for the chance to apply for asylum after her son's father was killed by a man who continued to threaten her family. When her number -- 1,506 -- was finally called, she and her son were soon released to await their court hearings under the juvenile protection laws. She lives now with a friend in Northern California, but she does not have a lawyer and isn't sure how to proceed with her case.\"I am very worried. I don't know what to do,\" she said.Families like Ms. Perez and her son are the biggest targets of Mr. Trump's fury. The president and his aides blame the nation's immigration laws -- the president derisively calls them \"Democrat laws\" -- for creating an incentive for migrants to bring a child with them to improve their chances of getting into the United States. One of them is the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, a 2008 bill signed into law by President George W. Bush that requires immigration authorities to treat migrant children differently than they do adults. The other is a 1997 legal settlement in a case known as Flores, which prevents the government from holding children or families in secure detention facilities for longer than 20 days.It was trying to get around those legal limits that prompted the administration last spring to begin forcibly separating migrant children from their parents -- detaining parents indefinitely while sending children to shelters and foster care. The fierce political backlash forced Mr. Trump to abandon that approach.The president's most recent initiative was the one calling for many migrants to remain in Mexico for the months or years it could take for an American judge to hear their case; that policy, too, when a federal judge in California blocked its implementation. For some migrants, the policy effectively meant no asylum case at all.Miguel Aquino, 29, who fled El Salvador in a caravan in October after being shot in the leg and hand by MS-13 gang members, waited for weeks in Tijuana to apply for asylum at the sprawling San Ysidro port, the biggest on the border. He was interviewed and sent back to Mexico to wait for a court date.In March, when he arrived for a preliminary hearing without an attorney, the judge gave him more time to find one -- and sent him back to Mexico to wait. Mr. Aquino said he has called eight lawyers, and they all said they couldn't represent him because he is in Tijuana. At this point, he is tired of waiting.\"The next time, if I don't go with a lawyer and they don't give a clear answer,\" he said, \"I'm going to look for another way to get in.\" Mr. Trump often says he plans to build a wall on the border with Mexico to halt illegal immigration. But when the standoff over funding for the wall led to a 35-day government shutdown in December and January, it actually made things worse. Many immigration judges were furloughed, and tens of thousands of deportation and asylum cases , in some cases for years. There is another problem with the wall: Slowing the exodus of migrants from Central America would need to start in those countries first.Central America's economies are still weak, and residents face drug and gang violence at levels largely unseen in other countries. Many are subject to deep poverty, a situation that recently reached a crisis with the collapse of coffee, corn and maize crops. M.C., a 23-year-old Guatemalan woman who asked to be identified by her initials for safety reasons, received an anonymous letter recently in her hometown, San Marcos, warning her that she would be killed if she did not give the letter writers 65,000 Guatemalan quetzals, nearly $8,500.M.C., who is three and a half months pregnant, went to the police in San Marcos. Then she got a second letter, warning her to never go to the police again. After she received a third letter, she made the decision to leave for the United States.\"I didn't want to come here at first, but then I think it's the best thing for the baby,\" M.C. said as she sat in a migrant shelter in the South Texas border city of Brownsville. \"Here, he's going to grow without crime. He can go to school.\"American diplomats say the best way to confront that kind of lawlessness is with the hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid that has been flowing to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras for several years, designed to bolster the rule of law and improve the economy.Last week, Mr. Trump abruptly abandoned those efforts, ordering the State Department to scrap about $500 million in aid to the three countries. Mr. Trump's decision has been criticized by members of both parties, who call it shortsighted.Likewise, critics say that Mr. Trump's repeated denigration of Mexico over the years -- including his insistence on building a border wall -- risks undermining Mexico's willingness to help to keep Central American migrants from traveling to the United States.\"This is the first Mexican administration that has even been oriented toward doing that,\" Ms. Meissner, the Clinton administration immigration commissioner, said. But blaming other countries and painting those coming across the border from Mexico as a national security threat has never failed to animate Mr. Trump's core supporters -- the ones who helped deliver him the White House in 2016.\"It's an invasion,\" Mr. Trump declared in February, after Congress denied him money to build a wall. \"We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.\"In fact, the migrants are mostly victims of the broken immigration system. They are not, by and large, killers, rapists or gang members. Most do not carry drugs. They have learned how to make asylum claims, just as the law allows them to do. And nearly all of them are scared -- of being shipped off to Mexico, separated from their children, sent to prison. Scared, especially, of going home."},

Peters", "contents": "WASHINGTON -- As a religious gay man who believes his party has ceded discussion of religion and spirituality to Republicans, Pete Buttigieg, a Democratic candidate for president, is talking about God and sexuality in an unconventional way: He is using the language of faith to confront the Christian right on territory they have long claimed as their own.Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has provoked a backlash from conservatives in the last few days after questioning the moral authority of evangelicals like Vice President Mike Pence who remain silent about President Trump's personal conduct yet disapprove of same-sex marriages and oppose gay rights.[]Though many conservatives were initially reticent to engage Mr. Buttigieg because they feared it would only add to his growing stature as a 2020 contender, they jumped on his latest comments. Some suggested he was attacking the vice president to further raise his profile. Others challenged Mr. Buttigieg's understanding of Christianity and accused him of smearing the religious convictions of the very people he wants to win over.A devoted Episcopalian who fluidly quotes Scripture and his husband, Chasten, in a church service last year, Mr. Buttigieg is making the argument that marriage is a \"moral issue.\" In a speech on Sunday to the Victory Fund, a group that supports gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender politicians, he said his relationship had made him \"more compassionate, more understanding, more self-aware and more decent.\"He then directly addressed Mr. Pence, as one man of faith talking to another: \"And yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God.\"This is not the domain where social conservatives and gay rights advocates are used to doing battle. In the decade and a half since same-sex marriage became a galvanizing issue for both sides, the national debate has largely focused on the tension between civil rights and individual freedoms.Mr. Buttigieg has reframed it in religious terms, raising questions about God, morality, sexuality and intolerance that depart from the familiar left-right fault lines. That quickly caught the attention of Republicans and conservative media commentators, who tried to cast his remarks as an unprovoked attack on faith-abiding Christians.Karen Pence, the vice president's wife, insisted Tuesday that her husband has no quarrel with Mr. Buttigieg. \"I don't think the vice president does have a problem with him,\" she in an interview with Fox News radio. \"I think in our country we need to understand you shouldn't be attacked for what your religious beliefs are,\" she added, noting that the speech was probably \"helping Pete to get some notoriety.\"Mr. Buttigieg, who has been mayor of South Bend since 2012, had a friendly working relationship with Mr. Pence while Mr. Pence was governor of Indiana. They toured factories together and occasionally exchanged text messages.But Mr. Buttigieg has cited Mr. Pence's support for legislation that made it easier for religious conservatives to refuse service to gay couples as a reason he decided to publicly in 2015.Mr. Pence's office responded to Mr. Buttigieg's comments this week by an old video clip in which he praised the mayor as a \"dedicated public servant and a patriot.\" Mr. Buttigieg's ramped-up attacks on Mr. Pence have miffed the vice president, who has privately told allies that if Mr. Buttigieg had questions about his religious beliefs, he could have asked him at any time during their friendship.The issue followed the vice president to the United Nations on Wednesday, where reporters shouted questions at him about whether being gay was a choice. Mr. Pence walked away without answering.The reaction from other conservatives was less measured. A Fox News host, Todd Starnes, accused the mayor of wanting \"to shove evangelical Christians into the closet.\"Erick Erickson, an evangelical blogger, said that Mr. Buttigieg's comments about religious conservatives who support Mr. Trump that he \"would be O.K. with using the government to persecute Christians.\" After Mr. Buttigieg spoke about his beliefs in an with USA Today, Mr. Erickson \"Mayor Pete Buttigieg Apparently Thinks Jesus Would Be Okay With Beastiality.\" (Mr. Buttigieg actually said nothing on that subject, though he did quote a favorite Bible verse: \"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others.\")Mr. Buttigieg has provoked a mixture of concern, derision and faint admiration from conservatives. Some built him up early as an undeniable but stealth force in the race. Rush Limbaugh warned his listeners that someone as articulate, personal and seemingly reasonable as Mr. Buttigieg would be a strong opponent. Ben Shapiro, the writer and podcast host, argued that he was the candidate who could most likely beat Mr. Trump. \"Really. He's not crazy, he's from the Rust Belt, he served in Afghanistan,\" Mr. Shapiro on Twitter.But this week provided a moment of clarity on the right, and the backlash was a reminder of how galvanizing religion and homosexuality can be when evangelicals and other conservatives of faith are convinced that their values are under attack. This sentiment, which was stoked by Mr. Trump and his allies in the Christian right in 2016, was a major factor in the president's huge margins with white evangelicals. Eighty-one percent voted for him, compared with 16 percent for Hillary Clinton.Indeed, if Mr. Buttigieg continues to gain in the polls, it could prompt the religious right to draw attention to numerous comments he has made about evangelicals and Mr. Trump -- \"the hypocrisy is unbelievable,\" he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" this week -- as conservatives did after Mrs. Clinton called Trump voters a \"basket of deplorables.\"Ralph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said Mr. Buttigieg's approach struck him as odd given how so much of his message has been focused on unity and restoring the Democratic Party's relationship with voters who are more religious and conservative. \"It seems to me the solution to that is not to attack the faith of anyone else, whether it is the president, the vice president or anyone else,\" Mr. Reed said. \"The solution should be to talk about their own faith.\"Mr. Buttigieg's words suggest that he will spend little effort trying to entice any of the president's most loyal religious supporters. But by pushing the discussion of homosexuality and marriage toward morality and the Bible, he is opening a door to voters of faith who are turned off by the dominance of the Republican Party's far right but are not yet convinced they could vote for a Democrat.That approach would be similar to the one Barack Obama took in 2008 when he received of the white evangelical vote. Mr. Trump's approval rating among white evangelicals has remained -- 69 percent as of January, according to the Pew Research Center. But that has slipped 9 points since his inauguration.Some evangelical Christians say that the fracture over Mr. Trump within their community runs so deep that the desire for an alternative -- especially one like Mr. Buttigieg, who is so temperamentally different from the profane, brash and unpredictable president -- will remain strong.Pete Wehner, an evangelical who worked in the George W. Bush White House and has split with his community and his party over Mr. Trump, said the way Mr. Buttigieg speaks with ease and familiarity about Christianity is a trait many voters will find to be a welcome contrast with the president.\"It's not a foreign language to him like it is to Donald Trump, so you're not going to get 'Two Corinthians' from him,\" Mr. Wehner said, referring to Mr. Trump's properly referred to as \"Second Corinthians.\"\"He speaks about faith in a way that is largely nonthreatening and not filled with anger,\" Mr. Wehner added. \"That is a real opening.\"But the unflagging devotion that most white evangelicals have for the president suggests that many will be far more concerned with policy results like conservative Supreme Court justices than with electing someone who speaks their language. The relevant question for Mr. Buttigieg is whether there is a critical mass of those who are wavering.\"Mayor Pete could not have hoped to capture conservative Christian voters or moderate Christian voters at any point in modern American history -- until now,\" said Jonathan Merritt, an evangelical author and speaker who disagrees with the decision by evangelical political leaders to stand by the president.Mr. Merritt, who believes the taint of hypocrisy has turned many young evangelicals like him away from traditional leaders, said he remembers growing up in the South when antipathy toward President Bill Clinton and his personal conduct was running hot.The line he remembers seeing and hearing over and over, he said, was \"character matters.\""},

Barr said on Wednesday that even after he released a partly blacked-out copy of the Mueller report, most likely next week, he would work to share with Congress some of the more sensitive information that he redacted.Mr. Barr also told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that while he intends to black out derogatory information about \"peripheral third parties,\" he would not take out criticisms of public office holders, including President Trump.Democrats have attacked Mr. Barr for on March 24 with what he called the report's \"bottom-line findings\": that the evidence the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, gathered did not show any conspiracy between Mr. Trump's associates and Russia, and that while the special counsel took no position on whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice, Mr. Barr deemed him cleared.Lawmakers have demanded to see the unredacted report, a request Mr. Barr tried to address on Wednesday.\"I intend to take up with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the chairmen and ranking members of each, what other areas they feel they have a need to have access to the information and see if I can work to accommodate that,\" Mr. Barr told the senators.His assurance did not mollify them. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, told him that any attempt to hide pieces of the report would \"only fuel suspicions that the Justice Department, which represents the United States, is playing the role of President Trump's defense team.\"Even while Mr. Barr sought to reassure lawmakers that he would treat the report in a transparent and fair manner, he also made a startling statement sure to please the president -- that investigative steps by the F.B.I. in 2016 to understand links between the Trump campaign and Russia amounted to \"spying\" on Mr. Trump's campaign, a portrayal law enforcement officials have vehemently denied.The attorney general was testifying about the Justice Department budget for the second straight day. But as happened on Tuesday, when he , questions about the Trump-Russia investigation led by Mr. Mueller and his still-secret full report dominated the hearing.Mr. Barr glancingly addressed a mystery raised by his March 24 letter, which did not explain why Mr. Mueller had rendered no judgment on whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice -- a silence that left open possibilities, including that the special counsel had wanted Mr. Barr to make the call, and that Mr. Mueller had intended for Congress to receive the evidence without the department weighing in.On Wednesday, Mr. Barr said that he had talked to Mr. Mueller about why he made no conclusion, and that the special counsel had not mentioned either of those possibilities to him. But the attorney general hinted that the answer might be known soon, saying that Mr. Mueller \"has a fuller explanation of that in the report that I'll be making available hopefully next week.\"Mr. Barr again declined to say whether he had recently briefed the White House on details of the report, even though Justice Department officials had previously said it had not been shown to the White House.The hearing also addressed criticism of the F.B.I.'s early decisions in 2016 to open a counterintelligence investigation into Russia's election-meddling operations that included scrutinizing any links between Russia and associates of the Trump campaign. The investigation, which Mr. Mueller took over the next spring, included assigning an informant to approach members of the Trump campaign with links to Russia and later obtaining a court order to wiretap a former Trump adviser with links to Russia after he left the campaign.During that part of the discussion, Mr. Barr used a startling word to describe those steps -- he said he thought \"spying\" on the Trump campaign had occurred. But he later seemed to tone down that formulation, saying his concern was whether \"illegal surveillance\" had taken place that was not \"adequately predicated\" -- and conceding that he had \"no specific evidence that I would cite right now.\"Responding to Mr. Barr's testimony, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, : \"These comments directly contradict what DOJ previously told us. I've asked DOJ to brief us immediately. In the meantime, the AG still owes us the full Mueller report.\"Meanwhile on Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a confirmation hearing for Jeffrey A. Rosen, whom Mr. Trump has nominated to be Mr. Barr's deputy. Mr. Rosen, who is currently the deputy secretary of transportation, would succeed Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr. Mueller.Mr. Rosen largely sidestepped questions about the Russia investigation and Mueller report, saying he was not part of the department yet and did not know the facts. But Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, noted that some criminal matters that developed from Mr. Mueller's work are continuing even though the Office of the Special Counsel is shutting down, and she pressed Mr. Rosen to commit to letting them proceed without political interference.\"If I am confirmed,\" Mr. Rosen replied, \"I would expect in all prosecutorial matters to proceed on the facts and the law and not any improper political influences.\"Ms. Klobuchar did not name which matters she had in mind, though several cases are still working their way through the court system, including the indictment of Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser to Mr. Trump.Separately, under questioning by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, Mr. Rosen defended his role in creating a Trump administration proposal on tailpipe pollution rules. Ms. Feinstein referred to that portrayed him as pushing to let cars emit more greenhouse gases. Mr. Rosen said the article had several errors, although he did not identify them.He also said the issue was how to carry out a law that required annual increases in fuel economy standards through 2020, and then set criteria for decisions about whether to require any further escalations in the years after that. The Trump administration, he said, was merely proposing a \"timeout\" after 2020.In fact, the current regulations, put forth by the Obama administration, require automakers to keep improving the fuel economy of passenger vehicles through 2025. The administration's preferred proposal would therefore allow more greenhouse gas pollution than current rules.Mr. Rosen also portrayed himself as playing a \"managerial\" role in overseeing the drafting of the rule, such as by ensuring deadlines were met. But 11 people interviewed by The Times at the time of the negotiation said Mr. Rosen pushed forcefully for that outcome.Mr. Rosen also addressed criticism that he -- like Mr. Barr and Brian A. Benczkowski, the head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division -- had no prosecutorial experience.He noted that the department had many experienced prosecutors, and said, \"I would make it my job to utilize and leverage the expertise they bring to bear while combining that with my own experience and judgment.\""},

Barr said on Wednesday that he would scrutinize the F.B.I.'s investigation of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, including whether \"spying\" conducted by American intelligence agencies on the campaign's associates had been properly carried out.\"I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,\" Mr. Barr said during testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, adding that he wanted to look into both \"the genesis and the conduct\" of the F.B.I. inquiry. He cast his interest as a matter of protecting civil liberties from potential abuse by the government.\"I think spying did occur,\" Mr. Barr said. \"The question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I'm not suggesting that it wasn't adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.\"The remarks by the new attorney general -- particularly his embrace of the term spying, which is frequently invoked by critics of the Russia investigation -- are certain to please President Trump and his allies, who have accused American law enforcement officials of targeting his campaign out of political malice.Mr. Barr's pledge, made as he prepares to make public in coming days a redacted version of the special counsel's report on the Russia inquiry, was a sign that after nearly three years of investigating the president's campaign and Russia, the Justice Department's focus may begin to shift in a direction that Mr. Trump has demanded.In addition to Mr. Barr's review of the F.B.I. investigation, the Justice Department's inspector general, a specially tasked United States attorney and Republicans in Congress are all studying key actions taken during the course of the inquiry. Those actions include how officials opened the Trump-Russia investigation, , and obtained a secret warrant to wiretap a former Trump campaign adviser.Mr. Trump's thirst for a reckoning among his inquisitors appears to have only grown in recent weeks. Minutes before Mr. Barr took the witness stand on Wednesday, the president called the investigation an \"attempted coup\" and claimed, again, that he had been \"totally exonerated\" by the report, despite the fact that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who took over the F.B.I.'s Russia investigation in 2017, explicitly said he could not clear the president of trying to obstruct justice.\"It was an illegal investigation,\" Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a . In some of his harshest criticism of the investigation to date, Mr. Trump said: \"Everything about it was crooked -- every single thing about it. There were dirty cops. These were bad people.\"\"This was an attempted takedown of a president,\" he added. \"And we beat them. We beat them.\"Mr. Mueller to Mr. Barr late last month. Much of Wednesday's hearing, and an earlier session with House lawmakers on Tuesday, was focused on that report, on continuing redactions of delicate information before it becomes public, and on Mr. Barr's characterization of what Mr. Mueller found.Mr. Barr, who said that he hoped to make a redacted version of Mr. Mueller's report public next week, used more measured tones in describing the review he intended to oversee than Mr. Trump did. The attorney general also signaled that he would wait to hear from others already at work, including , before replicating their review.He said he was not starting an investigation into the F.B.I. or any other law enforcement agency, per se, but he did allude to several of the bureau's former leaders who oversaw the opening of the Russia inquiry.\"To the extent there were any issues at the F.B.I., I do not view it as a problem that is endemic to the F.B.I.,\" Mr. Barr said. \"I think there was probably failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon.\"Mr. Barr did not present evidence to back up his statement, and he declined to share details about which investigative actions concerned him.The F.B.I. obtained a secret surveillance warrant to spy on one former Trump aide, Carter Page, after he left the campaign. Republicans in Congress because it used unverified Democrat-funded opposition research compiled into a dossier by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer. But a judge approved it, and it was not clear whether any laws were broken.Both Dana Boente, now the F.B.I. general counsel, and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, signed the FISA renewal application on Mr. Page.The bureau sought the wiretap on Mr. Page because of his previous contacts with a Russian intelligence officer in 2013 and material in the dossier. Among claims that Mr. Steele compiled from sources was that during a visit to Moscow in July 2016, Mr. Page secretly met a Russian official promising compromising information about Hillary Clinton -- an accusation that Mr. Page has denied.The F.B.I. also used a confidential informant to collect information on Trump campaign associates, which prompted more accusations of spying by the president.Mr. Trump or people close to him have leveled charges that have not borne out, including that President Barack Obama had ordered wiretaps on Trump Tower in Manhattan.Defenders of the F.B.I. have objected to the notion that it spied on the Trump campaign. The F.B.I. and Justice Department, they say, waited to seek a court order permitting it to wiretap Mr. Page until after he left the campaign and was on the verge of returning to Russia.Still, the wiretap order enabled F.B.I. agents to obtain and read older emails in Mr. Page's account, including when he was working with the campaign. The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, has asked those involved in that effort why they did not use a so-called filter team to review the messages and screen out any sensitive but irrelevant information before adding them to the Russia investigation case file. However, there appeared to be no rule requiring such a step, according to a person familiar with the inquiry.The inspector general has also asked about the handling of F.B.I. informants, including Mr. Steele and Stefan A. Halper, an American academic who teaches in Britain.After the F.B.I. opened the Russia investigation in late July 2016, agents asked Mr. Halper to gather information on Mr. Page and George Papadopoulos, another former Trump campaign adviser.Mr. Halper had also spoken to Mr. Page at a symposium that month, which has raised suspicions by critics of the F.B.I. that the investigation started earlier than the bureau has said. But that earlier encounter was a coincidence, according to a former federal law enforcement official.Mr. Barr appeared to be responding generally to those episodes, many of which have been the subject of news reports.\"I feel I have an obligation to make sure that government power is not abused,\" he said. \"I think that is one of the principal roles of the attorney general.\"Democrats involved in Congress's investigations of Russia's election interference quickly chastised Mr. Barr for using the term spying in a way that they believe feeds a right-wing conspiracy of F.B.I. wrongdoing.Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said it appeared he was \"going off the rails\" to protect Mr. Trump.Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, accused Mr. Barr of giving \"a wink and a nod\" to a \"long-debunked 'spying' conspiracy.\"And at one point, Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, pressed Mr. Barr on whether he had \"specific evidence of anything improper in the counterintelligence investigation.\" Mr. Barr said he did not.\"I have no specific evidence that I would cite right now,\" he said. \"I do have questions about it.\"But when Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, asked Mr. Barr if he had intended to use the term spying -- a term the senator said might \"cause everybody in the cable news ecosystem to freak out\" -- Mr. Barr rephrased his statement.\"I'm not sure of all of the connotations of that word that you're referring to,\" the attorney general said, then he added, \"I want to make sure there was no unauthorized surveillance.\"Mr. Barr, who began his career at the C.I.A., did not intend to imply that spying was inherently wrong, according to a person who has discussed the matter with him but was not authorized to share their conversation. Mr. Barr sees no technical difference between that term and surveillance. He indicated that at issue was not the act of surveilling but whether officials followed proper procedures when they decided to gather intelligence on Trump's associates in 2016.Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, elicited a response from Mr. Barr that invoked another era. When she asked why Mr. Barr was going to review the origins of the Russia investigation, he answered that \"the generation I grew up in, which is the Vietnam War period, you know, people were all concerned about spying on antiwar people and so forth by the government.\""},

Can New York Fix the B.Q.E.?", "authors": "Michael Kimmelman", "contents": "Sometimes life in New York can seem like an endless exercise in simply keeping bad from getting worse.Last week, crowds gathered in Brooklyn Heights to stick a collective finger in yet another crumbling dike, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Notoriously choked with traffic, a clattery, belching, potholed sluice of despair, built for 47,000 vehicles, now used by 153,000 cars and trucks a day, the long-neglected midcentury highway is collapsing. Experts -- in infrastructure terms, the day after tomorrow -- when big trucks may no longer be able to use it.Serving working stiffs from Staten Island, truck drivers from New Jersey, slicing smack through tony, litigious, brownstone Brooklyn, it is a modern American parable. Having bent the continent to our will, devising bridges and dams, railroads and highways, the United States in the early 21st century has fallen conspicuously behind other countries, paralyzed by our inability to fix failing infrastructure.We treat collapsing sewers and tunnels like trips to the dentist, procrastinating until disaster strikes, and then we have to spend a fortune on recovery. Faced with staggering costs, we squabble along partisan lines, pitting drivers against subway riders, suburbanites against city-dwellers, red versus blue -- blocking change in the name of prudence, missing one after another opportunity for progress.Summoned last week by community groups, the Brooklyn Heights Association and A Better Way, the crowd in Brooklyn Heights assembled for a town hall at lovely old Plymouth Church to help quash two nasty plans -- one painful, the other even more so -- that the city's forth a few months back.The for repairing the despised roadway, a crucial mile-and-a-half of which morphs into a six-lane triple-cantilever affair, clinging to the hillside beneath the Heights -- a kind of bunk-bed arrangement conceived during the 1940s by the prolific landscape architects Michael Rapuano and Gilmore Clarke.The cantilever system was a victory for People Power over the Establishment. It diverted the highway from running straight through the middle of Brooklyn Heights, as Robert Moses, the city's all-powerful planning czar back then, had wanted but community groups protested. The top bunk became the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, one of the loveliest spots in the whole city.Saving it is now inextricably linked to the destiny of the B.Q.E. Ideally, New York should leave the Promenade alone and probably just give up on this stretch of the expressway, the way other cities have torn down highways to create parks and flourishing neighborhoods -- the way the Bloomberg administration removed traffic from Broadway where it passes through Times Square.Drivers adapt. It's one of the counterintuitive laws of automotive behavior. We forget that car-centered urbanism didn't always have such a stranglehold on New York City. As late as the early 1950s, overnight street parking was illegal. Unfortunately, politicians and traffic engineers fixate on accommodating the number of drivers we have.And there seem to be more of them than ever, what with the subway's decline and hordes of Uber cars and Amazon delivery trucks.The solution, congestion pricing, may soon impose tolls to help fix the subways and reduce the number of cars and trucks on roads like the B.Q.E. A study released the other day by the Regional Plan Association -- commissioned by A Better Way -- suggested that congestion pricing could reduce traffic on the B.Q.E. into Manhattan by 13 percent, enough to allow the road to shrink down to four lanes. That's assuming politicians, catering to countless constituencies, don't exempt so many routes that congestion pricing becomes toothless.Some years ago, a B.Q.E. proposal surfaced that imagined digging a tunnel beneath Downtown Brooklyn to create a shortcut for the highway where it connected with the Brooklyn Bridge, reducing travel times and removing the entire cantilevered stretch past the Heights. It accommodated four lanes and looked attractive on paper. City officials say it will be as cataclysmic and complicated as Boston's Big Dig.Which is one explanation for the Department of Transportation's $4 billion plans. Choice A involved a decade or two of lane closings: total Carmageddon. Choice B turned the Promenade into a six-lane highway for nearly as long.As it happened, both plans were already pretty much shelved before the town hall meeting started. Mayor Bill de Blasio, reversing himself after several months, announced a \"\" would consider alternative proposals.There are a bunch of proposals out there now. One, by a Brooklyn planner named , a second elevated highway, a temporary parallel bypass, next to the cantilevered stretch of the B.Q.E.City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer has floated to close the B.Q.E. except to trucks, making one level of the elevated roadway a linear park. His likely opponent in the next mayoral race, City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, allying himself with many transportation advocates, wants to of highway with a more modest boulevard and spend the money that would have been used on its repair to improve public transit.Both politicians took to the Plymouth Church podium the other evening. The crowd cheered. But the most oohs and aahs came from the architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group, or BIG, which has an office in Dumbo. Cunningly labeled the BQP, for Brooklyn-Queens Park, BIG's plan has been quietly circulating among community leaders and transportation officials for a few weeks. It surfaced online and in The Daily News the day of the town hall.The plan moves the elevated B.Q.E. down to little-used Furman Street, which runs below the highway where it skirts Brooklyn Bridge Park. Furman would be widened by cutting into the berm now shielding the park from the highway. The berm, rebuilt, would then slide back over the new road, burying it -- at grade -- while making room above for the so-called BQX streetcar, if that were ever to happen, and also acres of new parkland.In essence, the elevated expressway would yield to a vast new wash of greenery extending Brooklyn Bridge Park all the way up to the Promenade.The benefits in terms of noise, air quality and open space are abundant. BIG says the disused cantilevers could be turned into more parkland or parking lots, revenue-generating shops or apartments, whatever Brooklynites wanted.Like the Clarke and Rapuano scheme, but for the 21st century, the BQP reframes an infrastructural headache as a civic opportunity. Back in 2011, the New York State Department of Transportation under Gov. Andrew Cuomo, clearly daunted by the challenge, simply fobbed off on the city the failing B.Q.E. -- which, as an interstate, was the state's responsibility. (The state can do that. It does this sort of thing all the time.)Mayor de Blasio then passed along the problem to Polly Trottenberg, the city's transportation commissioner, who has described fixing the elevated highway as \"the most challenging project not only in New York City, but arguably in the United States.\"To her credit she has now heard the outcry. She is open to other plans, BIG's included.There are many obstacles to the BQP and they are formidable. There is an immense sewer line that runs directly below Furman, serving much of Brooklyn.There are venting plants and substations for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that are in the way.One part of the plan imagines moving a lobby to the third floor of an occupied apartment building because the covered highway would abut the current entrance. Joralemon Street would become a dead end without any obvious place for cars to turn around.The list goes on.Brooklyn Bridge Park costs some $250,000 per acre per annum to maintain. It raises operating funds through private development. Brooklynites have spent years in court contesting even the smallest private incursions into the park. Unless the new parkland were financed differently, the added acreage via the BQP would require the construction of something along the lines of a brand-new 300,000 square foot condo or commercial development.Moses soured New Yorkers on big change. Resistance is the default mode. Whether the challenge is public housing, Hudson Yards, Penn Station or the B.Q.E., City Hall today doesn't seem to grasp the concept of urban design.The BQP sets a bar at least, which is worth pursuing. The mayor should do more than trust a panel of outside experts to judge what comes over the transom and offer quick solutions. The project needs state and federal buy-in. It requires a proper interagency master planning process, one steeped in community consultation. This takes time. And it can't be left up to traffic engineers.The crowd at Plymouth Church that arrived to man the barricades departed with the promise of something better.New Yorkers deserve as much."},

For more than a year a deal that would put an end to the chaos deepening in Venezuela. But no solution is viable as long as the country remains tethered to Cuba. The communications minister and government representative in the talks, Jorge Rodriguez, reiterated Venezuela's desire that it receive the same treatment as Cuba. This declaration laid bare the pretension of the regime: a dictatorship that is accepted and ultimately gets its way, like the one Raul Castro inherited from his brother and passed on to Miguel Diaz-Canel.But Cuba is more than an inspiration and a role model for the Chavismo government. The island nation has hijacked Venezuela and is effectively holding it hostage. Important government decisions are being made in Havana, not in Caracas. The Castro regime's tentacles extend to several Venezuelan governmental institutions, including the armed forces and the offices of immigration and health services.In a speech at the United Nations in October, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, at least 22,000 Cubans have infiltrated Venezuela's government and its institutions. They have done so, he explained, holding important positions in government agencies and in the national security and intelligence services.In the past few years Mr. Maduro's regime has moved to consolidate power and dismantle democratic institutions. In the 2015 parliamentary elections, opposition parties , but Mr. Maduro of its powers. The next year, the regime illegally postponed regional elections and suspended the process of calling for a presidential referendum. In 2017, we took to the streets to protest the illegitimate against the National Assembly, and we chose to not participate in the rigged regional elections. Civilian demonstrations against Maduro's dictatorship that year left , thousands wounded and hundreds imprisoned. According to Foro Penal, a prominent Venezuelan human rights organization, 911 political prisoners are being held in Venezuela. In the past year, seven attempts by the military to re-establish the Constitution and our sovereignty, today partially controlled by Cuban leadership, have been aborted. More than 100 military officers have been imprisoned.In the mediated talks with the Maduro regime, conducted in the Dominican Republic, we sought to agree on conditions for presidential elections with democratic guarantees, but the regime refused an electoral process that reflected the will of the Venezuelan people. We declined to sign the agreement, and the talks dissolved on January 2018. For years the opposition has tried to negotiate with the regime to find a democratic solution to this mess. Instead, Mr. Maduro pushed on with a sham presidential election on May 20, 2018, which was not recognized by Venezuelans and many of the world's democracies. Mr. Maduro's approach echoes the Cuban model, where a single party rules and elections aren't competitive.The inextricable relationship between the Castro dictatorship and the Chavista regime began 25 years ago, when Hugo Chavez visited Havana just after being released from prison. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and set in motion the collapse of the Soviet Union, Fidel Castro's Cuba lost its great economic benefactor. Mr. Chavez's rise to power in Venezuela a decade later allowed Mr. Castro to find a replacement. The relationship between the two countries was cemented between 2004 and 2014, when Venezuela experienced an .The relationship has proved lucrative for the Cuban government. Between 40,000 and 50,000 barrels of Venezuelan oil , despite the fact that Venezuelan oil production has declined more than 60 percent in recent years. Venezuela's economic subsidy reached its peak at about of Cuba's gross domestic product. During the boom years, around 90,000 barrels of crude oil daily, representing $9 billion annually, were sent to Cuba. Some estimate that over approximately 15 years, Venezuela has subsidized $35 billion in oil to Cuba. The country was brought further into debt when Mr. Maduro bought and sent it to Cuba between 2017 and 2018. The problem, therefore, is not a potential invasion of Venezuela by a foreign power; for over a decade, Cuba has been a parasite, stripping us of our resources.But unlike Cuba, we are not an island. We have land borders, and our tragedy has spread throughout the region, adding pressure to neighboring countries. To stabilize the region and restore democracy, we must cut off the authoritarian germ rooted in Cuba and Venezuela. Democracy cannot be restored until the two regimes are decoupled.Mr. Maduro has shown that he will not leave power of his own volition. Those of us who oppose his rule are not armed, nor do we seek to oust his regime violently. We have offered amnesty but it has been rejected. However, we will never accept the normalization of this de facto dictatorship. As long as Mr. Maduro remains in power there will be more deaths, prisoners, persecution and compatriots forced to migrate. The international community has exhausted its diplomatic arsenal because there is no precedent in Latin America for a situation similar to that of Venezuela's. When it comes, Mr. Maduro's exit will be equivalent to the fall of the Berlin Wall for the region.It is a mistake to ask those seeking democracy in Venezuela to distance themselves from their United States and Latin American allies at this juncture. They represent the only opportunity to counterbalance a regime with unlimited power and no institutional oversight, that is armed and willing to exercise violence. Democratic countries must direct pressure toward Havana as well to bring about change in Venezuela.The call of the National Assembly and the country's acting president, Juan Guaido, for Venezuela to stop sending oil to Cuba is a first step. Companies trading with Venezuelan oil must comply if they want to avoid secondary sanctions derived from those already imposed against our state-owned oil and gas company, P.D.V.S.A., by the United States. For its part, the Lima Group must ensure that previously agreed-upon investigations into corruption and human rights violations are carried out, which could involve citizens of its countries, as well as Venezuelans and Cubans.Finally, the international left wing must understand that Venezuelans are not victims of a single dictatorship, but of two: Mr. Maduro's and Cuba's. They must withdraw their solidarity and support for Nicolas Maduro.Julio Borges was president of the National Assembly of Venezuela and is Juan Guaido's ambassador to the Lima Group.

Edsall", "contents": "In the current election cycle, bets on moderation have few takers. Leading Democratic candidates are supporting bold progressive policy initiatives that are supported by liberal primary voters but may prove to be a tough sell to the general electorate. President Trump and his Republican allies will certainly try to use these initiatives against their Democratic rivals. They have in fact already begun to do so.A number of Democratic presidential candidates, for example, are calling for the of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and they have declared themselves in favor of such multibillion dollar programs as and a . Growing numbers of reparations to compensate black Americans for the costs of slavery and segregation.Why are these candidates willing to buck political tradition and heighten the risk of defeat on Nov. 3, 2020?Here is one answer, from , a political scientist at the University of Mississippi:Democrats contain much more heterogeneity across social groups than the more homogeneous white, Christian conservative Republican Party. To the extent the Democratic Party needs to entice and accommodate African-Americans, Latinos, environmentalists, etc. as voters, their candidates need to start embracing boutique policies for these groups that may not align with a general election \"median voter\" model of espousing moderate national policies.The issue of reparations illuminates the heterogeneity of the Democratic electorate. There are two surveys on reparations, a and a July 2018 poll by the liberal group . Both produced similar results.The Marist survey found overwhelming opposition among whites in response to the question As a way to make up for the harm caused by slavery and other forms of racial discrimination, do you think the United States should or should not pay reparations, that is, should or should not pay money to African-Americans who are descendants of slaves?Whites were opposed 81-15. Latinos were split, with 46 percent in support and 47 percent opposed. African-American voters support reparations, 58-35.The Data for Progress survey found sharp partisan divisions on the issue of reparations. Democrats supported reparations across the board: whites 37.8 to 30.5 percent; blacks 58.5 to 15.0 percent; Hispanics, 49.9 to 18.3 percent. Independents were opposed, 41.0 to 22.8 percent. Republicans were decisively in opposition, 77.1 to 8.9 percent.Among all voters, opposition to reparations was nearly twice as large as support, 47.1 to 26.4 percent.For the Democrats running for president, African-American backing is crucial both in the primaries and in the general election.Nationally, black voters in 2016 cast about in Democratic primaries. In four states, African-Americans cast the majority of votes: 71 percent in Mississippi, 61 percent in South Carolina, 54 percent in Alabama and 51 percent in Georgia.Let's look at another progressive initiative. In August 2018, voters if they support or oppose \"abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE?\" 41 percent opposed abolition and 24 percent supported it.Medicare for all and the Green New Deal pose a subtler dilemma for Democratic candidates. In the abstract, voters are supportive; the problems arise when the same voters are told key details, including costs.The best example of this is Medicare for all. In March, a found that a majority supported \"a national health plan or Medicare-for-all plan,\" 56-39, but support vacillates in both directions depending on how the program is portrayed.If, for example, Democrats posit that Medicare for all would eliminate health care premiums and reduce out of pocket costs, support rises to 67 percent with 30 percent opposed.Conversely, if Republicans succeed in portraying the program as leading to delays in getting medical treatment, or to the elimination of current private coverage, or to higher taxes, support collapses to the mid-20s and mid-30s, with opposition shooting up to the 60 to 70 percent range.Bold progressive stands may be risky in general elections, but recent research suggests that policy radicalism pays off in primaries.In a forthcoming paper, \",\" , a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, reports that voters in primary elections prefer candidates who are willing to take more extreme positions.\"Partisans are reacting most favorably toward ideological extremists,\" Lelkes wrote in an email:In fact, moderates are punished for the policies. Extreme politicians in the vein of Mike Lee and Elizabeth Warren, are rated roughly 20-25 points higher (on a 0 to 100 scale) by party identifiers than ideologically moderate politicians in the vein of Susan Collins and Joe Manchin. These effects are even larger among ideologically extreme respondents -- the kind that vote in primary elections.Lelkes conducted experiments that asked participants to rate a number of hypothetical candidates, including a moderate Democrat, an \"ideologically extreme\" liberal Democrat, a moderate Republican and an \"ideologically extreme\" conservative Republican.He found that the most ideologically committed voters -- who are disproportionately represented in primaries and caucuses -- strongly preferred more extreme candidates:The impact of policy cues was particularly strong among respondents who themselves held strong policy positions. If a respondent was told that candidate held extreme in-party views, ideologically extreme respondents registered ratings 35.89 points warmer than ideologically neutral respondents.Lelkes's conclusion?If we are to decrease affective polarization in the United States, we need politicians that are politically moderate. Unfortunately, voters prefer politicians of their own party that are politically extreme. This incentivizes extreme political candidates, which will only exacerbate current tensions.There are dangers for both parties is these trends, Lelkes argues, citing a 2015 study of House elections, \"\" by , a political scientist at Stanford.Hall found that when a more extreme candidate beats a moderate in the primarythe party's general-election vote share decreases on average by approximately 9--13 percentage points, and the probability that the party wins the seat decreases by 35--54 percentage points.Gallup data shows the steady ascendance within Democratic ranks of self-identified ideological liberals and a parallel decline in the share of Democrats who say they are moderate or conservative. From 1973 to 2018, as I have , the percentage of Democrats who say they are liberal from 25 to 51 percent, while the share of moderates has fallen from 48 to 31 percent, and the share of conservatives has dropped from 25 to 13 percent.A showed a steady process of ideological consolidation among both Republicans and Democrats since 1994, although consolidation accelerated most rapidly on the left:The share of Democrats who are liberal on all or most value dimensions has nearly doubled from just 30 percent in 1994 to 56 percent today. The share who are consistently liberal has quadrupled from just 5 percent to 23 percent over the past 20 years.In a reflection of their importance in primaries, \"consistently liberal\" Democrats turned out in elections at a 70 percent rate, compared with 47 percent for \"mostly liberal\" Democrats and 41 percent for Democrats with \"mixed views,\" according to Pew data.These and other trends, according to , a senior fellow at the liberal think tank, represent the changing the mind-set of the Democratic electorate. In an email, Drutman wrote:Two related dynamics are operative. One, Democratic voters have moved to the left in response to Trump, and are eager for policies that signal transformative change, not just incrementalism. There is no return to normalcy, because the past is now seen as more flawed.This dynamic has intensified because the most engaged Democrats, Drutman writes,have bought into an argument that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 because she was too incrementalist, and had she gone a little bolder and promised something more exciting than her competence and experience, she might have won.The second dynamic, Drutman continued, is thatin a crowded field, candidates are seeking to distinguish themselves with grass-roots energy. A very effective way of generating grass-roots energy is attaching to transformative changes these policies signal. Incrementalism and moderation doesn't generate much excitement among the activists or in coverage from journalists who are responsible for driving candidate buzz in these early stages.In a similar analysis, , a political scientist at George Washington University, argues thatOn race and immigration in particular, I think Trump is pushing Democrats to the left. To be clear, Hillary Clinton was already to Obama's left even in 2016. But I think Trump's rhetoric and agenda has made conservative positions on race and immigration even more anathema to Democrats.Sides also pointed out that the incentives for Democratic candidates have shifted:It used to be the case that Democratic candidates had to moderate on racial issues to maintain a Democratic coalition that included both blacks and some racially conservative whites. But the Democratic coalition has changed: it is increasingly made up of not only nonwhites but whites who espouse racially liberal attitudes.In an argument elaborating on a point made by Drutman, , a political scientist at Indiana University, made the case that the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton fostered the shift to the left:If a moderate policy agenda cannot guarantee electoral victory why downplay your leftward policy orientations in the unlikely event that it will jeopardize your electoral success?Carmines added:Trump's success has reinforced this perspective. He won with a very right-wing policy agenda. Perhaps a left-wing set of proposals can lead Democrats to similar success.Carmines believes that \"both of these premises are mistaken and could very well lead Democrats to electoral defeat when victory is within sight.\", a political scientist at Stony Brook University, argues that the liberal tilt of the Democratic candidates is, in fact, a rational political strategy. \"There is real change afoot with the most recent generations,\" she wrote, citing released in January:Young Republicans are especially different from older Republicans and the Democratic Party is likely to regard such findings as an invitation to poach more liberal young Republicans.Strong partisans, however, Huddy writes, \"are unlikely to defect from the party in 2020 regardless of its issue agenda,\" and political independentsare younger, on average, than partisans. Appealing to young voters thus makes political sense when it comes to the general 2020 presidential election., a political scientist at the University of California-San Diego, has a somewhat different take on the changing character of the Democratic electorate and the party's presidential candidates.The candidates, Jacobson wrote by email, \"are playing to their activist base whose enthusiasm helped produce their House victory in 2018.\"He warned, however, that \"leaning left does carry risks; there are not enough liberals (or progressives, if you prefer) to form a majority nationally or in the Electoral College.\"In contemporary presidential campaigns, according to Jacobson,the tricky thing is that in an era of extremely high party line voting, turnout becomes enormously important. Trump has proven to be a great mobilizer of Democrats, but they still have to consider how enthusiastic ordinary Democrats will be about their nominee.Trump, Jacobson noted, willtry to mobilize his base by ranting about \"socialism\" and of course some potential Democratic candidates will be more vulnerable to that charge than others.The strategic choices facing prospective Democratic nominees are, in the view of , a political scientist at U.C.L.A., even more complex and subtle than those described by Jacobson.Taking very liberal stands on contested issues, she wrote me,might not pose \"significant risks\" if you think your minimum winning coalition of voters is made up of people who either share your preferences on these things, or for whom these policies are not pivotal in their vote decision.She elaborated:There are people for whom these issues are important, but for whom there's no position a Democrat could take that would make them decide not to vote for that Democrat. There are other people, presumably, for whom these issues are so important and their preferences so intense, that any Democrat who takes a position far from their own is a Democrat for whom they won't vote. It depends which type of people you think are in your winning coalition as to whether you stake out positions on these things., a professor of communication, public policy and urban affairs at Northeastern and editor in chief of the journal Environmental Communication, addressed only the support for a Green New Deal by some Democratic candidates. His view is pessimistic.In an email, he wrote:The Green New Deal has done damage to the Democratic Party's chances heading into the 2020 elections, while hurting efforts to build momentum on behalf of climate and energy policy options capable of passing during an era of enduring divided government.In in the spring edition of Issues in Science and Technology, Nisbet contends that the goal of Green New Dealersis not to broker cross-alliances between the center-right, center-left, and left wing, drawing on the best ideas that those factions can offer, but rather to build progressive power.In an interesting development, the momentum behind the more radical Democratic agenda has turned both Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi into defenders of the party's old guard.Pelosi, who has been trying with mixed success to tamp down the left wing of the House Democratic caucus, recently on Medicare for all in an interview with The Washington Post.At first she said, \"I'm agnostic. Show me how you think you can get there.\" But then she cautioned:So we'll have hearings, again, let's see what it is. Right now it's a $30 trillion price tag. What do people get for that in terms of care, and what do they pay for that along the way?Implicit in her comment is the belief that $30 trillion is not acceptable to the American public.Obama, at a town hall in Germany earlier this month, warned of the dangers of uncompromising ideology for the progressive wing of his party:One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States -- maybe it's true here as well -- is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, 'Uh, I'm sorry, this is how it's going to be,' and then we start sometimes creating what's called a 'circular firing squad,' where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues. And when that happens, typically the overall effort and movement weakens.For the moment, both Obama and Pelosi are having minimal influence as far as the leftward thrust of the Democratic presidential nomination goes.Three years ago, Trump threw out conventional wisdom and went on to win the nomination and the presidency. Maybe, this time around, Democrats can gamble successfully on a similar strategy and win. Or maybe not. "},
{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/opinion/netanyahu-israel-election.html", "title": "Why Israel Still Loves Netanyahu", "authors": "Shmuel Rosner", "contents": "JERUSALEM -- There are more than a few reasons to dislike Benjamin Netanyahu. He can be smug and vindictive. He can be ruthless when going up against political enemies. He is likely to be indicted on corruption charges related to three separate cases, which, if they are accurate, indicate that he is greedy, vain and manipulative.And yet last night, this dislikable prime minister appears to have won his fifth -- yes, fifth! -- term in office. If he forms a government in the coming weeks, as he is expected to, Mr. Netanyahu will surpass Israel's founder David Ben Gurion as the country's longest serving prime minister. How is this possible?To be fair, this was a close race. The main opposition party, Blue and White, is expected to get as many seats in the Knesset as Mr. Netanyahu's Likud party. The coalition that he forms will probably have little more than the minimum 61 seats behind it.Given Mr. Netanyahu's unsavory qualities, many people were intent on defeating him. Just a few months ahead of the election, Blue and White, a new centrist alliance led by three decorated generals and a former security minister, came together with little purpose other than to present an alternative to Mr. Netanyahu, who has been in power since 2009. They campaigned fiercely -- but civilly. At rallies, General Benny Gantz, the head of Blue and White, made it a habit to thank the prime minister for his service to the nation; this was a mirror image of Mr. Netanyahu's and Likud's name-calling and personal attacks. But civility and centrism weren't enough to carry the day.Mr. Netanyahu may be cynical but he doesn't rig elections. He wins fairly, often against great odds, including, this time, the coming indictments against him and an understandable fatigue with his decade-old leadership, not to mention various other inter- and intraparty squabbles. But he seems to have succeeded again this time for the same reason he has dominated Israeli politics for most of the past 25 years: because when it comes to Israel's national security, he is a leader with strategy and vision. And that is what many voters want.In the mid-1990s, during his first term as prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu rejected the assumptions underlying the peace process with the Palestinians. At the time this was considered daringly right wing. Today, it is considered common sense in Israel, including by Mr. Netanyahu's political rivals. Likewise, Mr. Netanyahu was one of the first politicians to recognize Iran as the main threat to Israel's survival, and fought fiercely in international forums to get the world's attention to this problem. Today, this view is also widely appreciated across the Israeli political spectrum.The list goes on: In 2005, he warned that withdrawing Israeli troops from Gaza would end in disaster -- and it did. He successfully resisted eight years of the Obama administration's pressure to offer concessions to the Palestinians. He quickly forged an alliance with President Trump that has already proved to be of great benefit to Israel. In two years, Mr. Trump has moved the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, withdrawn from the nuclear agreement with Iran, recognized Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and on Monday, designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization.Blue and White tried to make this election a referendum on Mr. Netanyahu. Its campaign focused largely on the prime minister's personal failings, the corruption accusations against him, and exhaustion with his leadership. But in Israel, security trumps all other issues. ( found voters rated security as their No. 1 concern.)Blue and White thought that by placing former Israel Defense Forces chiefs of staff at the top of the party list, it could counter Mr. Netanyahu's image and experience as a defender of Israel, diplomatically and militarily. But the public still showed that it trusts the incumbent more.Has Mr. Netanyahu ever been wrong when it comes to security? The truth is, many Israelis will find it hard to think of an example. And this goes not just for voters for the Likud party, or even the right-wing parties that are expected to join Likud in the next government, but even for Blue and White, which largely echoed Mr. Netanyahu's positions on important foreign policy and national security questions.Those Israelis who do want Mr. Netanyahu gone -- and yes, there are many -- want him gone because of his personality, his coarsening of Israeli political discourse, his pettiness and, maybe, his corruption. Those Israelis who want Mr. Netanyahu to stay -- and the election makes clear that there are many -- want him to stay despite those same characteristics. They can forgive the prime minister for often being a small man, because they appreciate him as a great leader."},

Friedman", "contents": "There are two countries that I've been professionally, emotionally and intellectually involved with my entire journalism career -- the United States and Israel. I've never been more worried about both, because President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are essentially the same person, and they pose the same threat to their respective nations.They are both men utterly without shame, backed by parties utterly without spine, protected by big media outlets utterly without integrity. They are both funded by a Las Vegas casino magnate, Sheldon Adelson. They are both making support for Israel a \"Republican'' cause -- no longer a bipartisan one. And they each could shoot an innocent man in broad daylight in the middle of Fifth Avenue and their supporters would say the victim had it coming.As a result, they are each free to cross red lines that their predecessors never dared to. Which is why I believe that four more years of Netanyahu, which is almost certain after Israel's election on Tuesday, and six more years of Trump, which is a real possibility, will hasten the emergence of an America and an Israel where respect for civility, democracy, an independent judiciary and independent media are no longer examples for others to follow. Instead, both countries will be cautionary tales of how precious are the norms and institutions that bind a democracy, and how easily they can be undermined by leaders who will tell any lie, smear any competitor and wink at any extremist to stay in power.Netanyahu's first order of business will be to strike an agreement with his potential coalition partners, most of them far-right, pro-settler parties, in which, as Haaretz reported, those parties will agree to create legislation that gets rid of the multiple indictments for corruption looming in Bibi's future -- and in return he will agree to annex West Bank settlements to Israel. And Trump will somehow go along, maybe as part of his own peace plan. It is going to be a dirty business, for sure.But what else could we expect? The parallels between Trump and Netanyahu are now deep and broad.Bibi has openly embraced a racist, anti-Arab Israeli party and racist, anti-Arab rhetoric, unlike any previous Israeli prime minister. At the same time, he has steadily been erasing the Green Line that separated Israel from the West Bank and its 2.5 million Palestinians -- with the help of Trump's ambassador to Israel -- making it increasingly unlikely that Israel will ever separate itself from that area and increasingly likely that it will become a binational state in which Jews will enjoy rights that Palestinians will be denied.Meanwhile, Trump is increasingly turning America into a banana republic, firing cabinet officials and senior bureaucrats who refuse to carry out his impulsive orders, which are often illegal and mostly related to preventing legal and illegal immigration or asylum requests along the Mexico-United States border. Trump prefers to govern through \"acting'' cabinet secretaries -- he has fired their bosses and not replaced them -- who are much more vulnerable to his whims and more accepting of his more than 10,000 lies and falsehoods since taking office.Bibi, for his part, prefers to simply hold multiple portfolios: For a good chunk of his last term he was prime minister, defense minister, foreign minister and health minister.Both men have no close friends. The one major difference between them is that Bibi is very smart, an avid reader and a deft tactician in managing relations with Israel's neighbors and big powers, such as America, Russia, India and China. Trump is clever but probably has not read a book in years. He gets his information from Fox News and other right-wing media, and rather than playing Vladimir Putin, has been played by him.Both Trump and Netanyahu are being investigated for serious financial improprieties. Israel's attorney general has recommended that Netanyahu be indicted on charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust in three corruption cases.Trump has been cleared by the special counsel on charges of collusion with Russia in the 2016 election, but he remains under investigation, as Reuters noted, on \"issues including his businesses and financial dealings, personal conduct, charitable foundation and inaugural committee.'' Five close Trump aides have already admitted to crimes, mostly financial, or been convicted.Neither man is interested in being a leader for all their people. Each has chosen to rule by dividing his people, not uniting them. They each just want to win by 50.01 percent, by using fear of the outsider and drawing cultural or religious distinctions between their citizens to garner just enough votes to squeak by.Bibi's strategy was to demonize Israeli Arabs, and Trump's was to demonize Muslims and Mexicans and immigrants from what he called \"shithole'' countries. Both men have rebuilt their parties around themselves and their personal politics, and both believe that as long as they can hold their bases by stoking enough fear and cultural division, they can win -- and they're willing to sacrifice any values or norms to do so.Neither man is entirely wrong about the world around him. America does have an illegal immigration problem that Democrats have not taken seriously enough. Israel has real enemies like Iran and its proxies. But Israel's external enemies are well deterred. The existential threat to Israel is that it will annex the West Bank with its Palestinian population and look to the world as an apartheidlike South Africa.My critique of both men is that they consistently try to use these real threats for political gain -- to feed fears, rather than to think creatively about how to defuse them. Because for Bibi to think imaginatively about how to separate from the West Bank and for Trump to think creatively about how to defuse our immigration problem with a coherent national strategy would require each to disappoint or confront the extreme ultranationalists who form the core bases of their support. Neither has the courage or the desire to do so.Indeed, Netanyahu has gone so deep into the gutter that in this last election he agreed to partner with a small, racist, anti-Arab Israeli party -- a party so vile that the Israeli Supreme Court barred its leader from running. In response, Netanyahu's allies immediately threatened to gut the Supreme Court if they win. I don't have to tell you where Trump has gone in indulging white supremacists.Bibi will go down in history as the Israeli leader who concretized the distinction between \"Israelis'' and \"Jews,'' noted Bernard Avishai in a smart essay in The New Yorker: \"The menace, Netanyahu has implied, is not just the Arabs but what might be termed Israeliness -- a legal and cultural identity available to any citizen who participates in Hebrew-speaking civil society, including the 20 percent who are Arab.''While Benny Gantz, Bibi's opponent in the recent election, has argued that, broadly defined, \"Israeli identity is increasingly plausible for, among others, young, middle-class Arabs, who accounted for more than 16 percent of students in bachelor's degree programs in 2017,'' that is not Netanyahu's view.\"Netanyahu's version, in contrast,'' Avishai explained, \"is a state essentially reserved for Jews, including those in the diaspora, who can prove their Jewishness by either rabbinical certification or maternal descent -- one that is democratic only in the sense that Jews constitute the majority, the general will of Jews necessarily prevails, and non-Jews are in the state by sufferance, not really by right.''That is why Netanyahu passed the recent Nation-State Law, which stipulated that Israel is \"the national home of the Jewish people, in which it fulfills its natural, cultural, religious and historical right to self-determination.\" However much American Jews -- and traditional, secular American Jewish supporters of Israel -- \"may try to shield Netanyahu, it is increasingly clear that he is at odds with their democratic standards, which are already under assault,'' Avishai concluded. \"American Jews, like Israeli voters, have choices to make.'' Is Israel a state for Jews or for all its citizens?Trump has dabbled in the same kind of tropes. He may not say it explicitly, but his whole worldview, evident from his dog whistles, is that are primarily white Judeo-Christians -- certainly not Muslims -- and that all black or brown immigrants are suspect.Finally, both Trump and Bibi worship only one thing -- raw, naked power, and they are not afraid to exercise it. Bibi is convinced that if Israel is strong militarily, economically and technologically, the world will bend to its will and beat a path to its door. The Palestinians will surrender; the Arabs will deal with Israel under the table; and China, India and Russia will all come to buy Israeli software. And so far he has been right. Bibi is convinced that liberal American Jews are worthless, that they'll soon disappear via intermarriage and that the country's Orthodox Jews and evangelical Christians will be powerful enough to do Israel's bidding in Washington.Trump too has an obsession with raw power; his favorite insult is to call someone \"weak.'' He lives by the credo: Never apologize, no matter how foul your actions or how big your lie. Just stand firm and everyone will eventually bend your way. It has worked for him too. But at what long-term costs for both societies?Trump is replacing the entire logic of American foreign policy since World War II -- that more global integration and stronger global rules and institutions will make for a more prosperous world, and if America pays a little more than others for that we will reap far more benefits because we are the world's biggest economy -- with a philosophy of competitive nationalism.For Trump, all the global institutions built after World War II -- NATO, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the United Nations -- are just tools for small countries to rip off America or stick it to Israel. Trump actually wants the European Union to crack up, because he thinks that if the United States just negotiates with every nation bilaterally, it will be able to impose asymmetrical trade agreements on them.So have no doubts: Four more years of Netanyahu and six more years of Trump won't just change America and Israel. It will change the world -- and not for the better."},

Mr. Netanyahu has set a course that could end Palestinian chances for statehood, threaten Israel's democratic character and deepen the alienation between its right-wing coalition government and a majority of American Jews. Mr. Netanyahu can still choose to try to repair the damage from an ugly campaign. During an election night celebration, he promised to be \"the prime minister of all the citizens of Israel.\" We hope he will, although he has not governed that way up to now and has formed alliances with extreme right-wing parties., a centrist former military chief and Mr. Netanyahu's main rival, conceded defeat on Wednesday, paving the way for Mr. Netanyahu to become Israel's longest-serving leader.Still, forming a government is expected to take weeks of horse trading. In theory, a broad coalition based on Mr. Netanyahu's Likud party and Mr. Gantz's formed only a few weeks ago with two other military chiefs, could be the best option, forcing Mr. Netanyahu to compromise on his extreme policies. But analysts say it's far more likely he will stitch together a coalition that depends on ultra-Orthodox and ultranationalist parties, driving the government further to the right and worsening the country's political divide. One question hanging over Mr. Netanyahu's victory is involving donors and friendly media outlets. The scandal could cut short his tenure. On Mr. Netanyahu's watch, Israel has evolved into an economically vibrant, technologically innovative country that has improved ties to leading Arab states (even if the only peace agreements are still with Egypt and Jordan) and expanded a number of international relationships, including with Russia, China and India.Israel also is strong enough, either by itself or with the United States, to defeat any enemy. Yet its people remain fearful, especially of Iran.And some Israelis are even fearful of their fellow citizens who are Arabs. Mr. Netanyahu successfully exploited these fears to his political advantage.He has accelerated construction of thousands of new housing units for settlers in the West Bank and removed Arabs from their homes in East Jerusalem, steadily shrinking the land available for a Palestinian state.In a desperate bid to secure re-election, Mr. Netanyahu publicly aligned with a tiny party, or Jewish Power, led by followers of the extreme nationalist , the Brooklyn-born rabbi whose Kach party was outlawed in Israel in the 1980s and placed on the American list of terrorist groups in 1997. Otzma Yehudit advocates annexing the occupied territories, expelling \"enemies\" -- widely understood to mean Arabs -- and seizing the Temple Mount, a move tantamount to declaring war on Islam. Once Mr. Netanyahu crossed this line, perhaps it should not have been surprising that days before the voting he went even further and said he would begin effectively that are expected to be incorporated in any Palestinian state.Standing behind him in all this , who inserted himself on behalf of an Israeli leader in ways no previous American president has. Mr. Trump from Tel Aviv, recognized Israeli , that is the link with the Palestinians, and to the Palestinians in an apparent attempt to force them to abandon their dreams of an independent state.At a congressional hearing on Tuesday, -- he refused to publicly recommit the United States to a two-state solution and to say whether it opposes unilateral annexation of the West Bank.In the process, the United States and Israel have upended decades of American policy, United Nations Security Council resolutions and agreements like the 1993 Oslo Accords, which said the borders of Israel and Palestine, the future of Jerusalem, security arrangements and the fate of Palestinian refugees would be negotiated by the two parties.Under Mr. Netanyahu, Israel is on a trajectory to become what critics say will be an apartheid state like the former South Africa -- a country in which Palestinians will eventually be a majority, but without the rights of citizens. That's not good for Israel, nor for the United States., a former head of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, says his country refuses to confront a basic dilemma about what it wants to be in 40 years. He told The Times that the war most Israelis think they are fighting -- over the recognition, sovereignty and security of their state -- was actually won decades ago. The war now being fought is over expanding Israel's eastern border by building more settlements and demanding a Palestinian state alongside Israel.\"We are doing everything in order to create a virtual reality in which Palestinians cannot exist,\" Mr. Ayalon said. \"It is not a just war,\" he added. \"It will be a catastrophe if we should win. It is the end of our Zionist dream.\""},

Adultery is one of the crimes for which the archaic penalty is prescribed under the stern laws that went into effect on April 3 -- along with sex between men, abortion and rape -- and tabloids around the world have accumulated plenty of evidence against some Bruneian royals.Such royal hypocrisy may seem to be the norm among autocratic rulers sitting atop oceans of oil who place no limits on their own dissolute lifestyles and yet impose cruel Islamic law on their subjects. And tiny Brunei, a country roughly the size of Delaware that shares the island of Borneo with Malaysia and Indonesia, might not seem worth getting worked up about.Yet it is, for several reasons. First is that \"this is the way we do it\" is no longer a viable excuse for cruelty and barbarism anywhere. The world has gone way past times when witches were burned, homosexuals castrated or adulterers branded, and Brunei has signed (but not yet ratified) the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.Brunei's cruel, inhuman and degrading penalties are not a relic of history, like the sodomy laws that stayed on the books of American states well into the 20th century, but the whim of 72, who has ruled the Lilliputian nation since 1967 and ranks among the most ludicrously wealthy people on earth. He has long pushed his predominantly Muslim nation toward a conservative and restrictive form of Islam, and he first announced the new penalties -- which, in addition to death by stoning for gay male sex, include amputation for theft and 40 lashes for lesbian sex -- six years ago.An international outcry at that time prompted him to delay the laws. A similar outcry has accompanied their latest introduction: The United States, the European Union, Australia and others, as well as the United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, have all denounced the penalties, and celebrities including Elton John, Billie Jean King and Ellen DeGeneres called for , which include the Beverly Hills Hotel, the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles, the Dorchester in London and the Hotel Plaza Athenee in Paris.Besides the barbarity of the penalties, there is the danger that the law could nudge neighboring Islamic giants Malaysia and Indonesia toward tightening their own national or regional versions of Shariah laws targeting homosexuals. Conservative Muslim politicians in both countries were quick to . Beyond that, there is the fact that Sultan Hassanal enjoys his absolute dominion and his obscene treasure, including a gold-plated Rolls-Royce and a 1,788-room palace, because the world outside buys his oil. That gives his clients -- including Britain, Brunei's former colonial master -- a measure of responsibility and leverage.That celebrities are taking action is good, but governments and multinationals that do business with the wealthy sultanate have an obligation to look for ways to persuade Sultan Hassanal and other beneficiaries of Brunei's oil riches that they best quickly bring their laws into compliance with their human rights obligations and abandon vicious punishments for blameless behavior."},

", "authors": "Farhad Manjoo", "contents": "A few months ago, I stumbled onto a new way of writing. I don't mean an unusual literary or textual style; I mean a new physical method for the painstaking task of chiseling the formless geologic schists inside my brain into words and sentences crisp and coherent enough to please at least a few of my fellow human beings.Here's what I do: Instead of writing, I speak. When a notable thought strikes me -- I could be pacing around my home office, washing dishes, driving or, most often recently, taking long, aimless strolls on desolate suburban Silicon Valley sidewalks -- I open , a cloud-connected voice-recording app on my phone. Because I'm pretty much always wearing wireless headphones with a mic -- yes, I'm one of those AirPod people -- the app records my voice in high fidelity as I walk, while my phone is snug in my pocket or otherwise out of sight.And so, on foot, wandering about town, I write. I began making voice memos to remember column ideas and short turns of phrases. But as I became comfortable with the practice, I started to compose full sentences, paragraphs and even whole outlines of my columns just by speaking.Then comes the magical part. Every few days, I load the recordings into , an app that bills itself as a \"word processor for audio.\" Some of my voice memos are more than an hour long, but Descript quickly (and cheaply) transcribes the text, truncates the silences and renders my speech editable and searchable. Through software, my meandering memos are turned into a skeleton of writing. The text Descript spits out is not by any means ready for publication, but it functions like a pencil sketch: a rough first draft that I then hammer into life the old-fashioned way, on a screen, with a keyboard, lots of tears and not a little blood.Writing by speaking has quietly revolutionized how I work. It has made my writing more conversational and less precious. More amazingly, it has expanded my canvas: I can now write the way street photographers shoot -- out in the world, whenever the muse strikes me (or more likely, when I'm loafing around, procrastinating on some other piece of writing). Most of my recent columns, including large portions of this one, were written this way: first by mouth, not fingers.There is something more interesting here than a newspaper columnist's life hack. I began writing-by-speaking as part of a deeper exploration into living inside what I call the \"screenless internet\" -- which may well become the internet of tomorrow, for better and worse.Late last decade, smartphones liberated computers from our desks, which was thrilling until we realized they were also shackling us into a distracted, addictive . Now, as we reach , it is becoming possible to see the outlines of a less visually arresting path ahead.New advances -- like smarter and more ubiquitous voice assistants; better text-to-speech synthesis; easy-to-use audio and video production apps like Descript and ; and gadgets that burrow the internet into your ears, like Apple's AirPods and -- point to a profound shift in computing. Soon it might be possible to conduct a large slice of digital life, including work, without being glued to a screen. What will that be like? In what ways will it be better than what we have today -- and in what ways worse?To begin to understand these questions, I've been trying to live without screens. Two or three mornings a week, I'll put on my headphones and some comfortable walking boots (Docs and Timbs are my go-to), then I'll head out to the beaten sidewalk. My aim is to see how much I can get done with my mouth and my ears, to understand how interacting with computers mostly by speaking and listening might change computing, and how it might change us.Now, I'll grant that my \"work\" is unnatural and a little bizarre. Still, I was surprised at how much of it can be done without a screen. As a columnist, I spend large chunks of the day ingesting and analyzing information. I'll read the news, read magazines and books, and try to find sources and experts to talk about whatever I find interesting.At my office, I'd do all of this on a screen. But I can now find just as much news and expertise on the screenless internet. Indeed, in many ways, screenless content is better. Podcasts and audiobooks offer the sort of intimate peek at expertise that I remember from the amateur blogosphere circa 2003: a nuanced, serious, ongoing conversation about the news, one that feels more intimate, less clickbaity and less reflexively partisan than today's visual web. And it's efficient, too. Listening on double-speed, I can power through news and audiobooks in no time, and without distraction. When information is coming through my ears, I feel less anxiety to constantly look for something new, the way we are encouraged to do on the pull-down-for-more touch-screen internet of today.There are readers who'll say this experiment sounds silly, that the pull of screens is so strong it is folly to imagine a world without them. Others might suggest that the screenless internet, if it comes, will bring its own peculiar horrors: Picture dead-eyed AirPodders mumbling incantations to robotic assistants as they amble zombielike through Times Square (directed by Jordan Peele).I'm wary of such dangers (and others yet to be imagined). Yet the more I write by speaking, the more hopelessly I fall for a screenless future. The bottom line, for me, is how magically even my jury-rigged method collapses the distance between my thoughts and the computer.As this distance collapses further -- as computers begin to understand our speech and then our thoughts with high fidelity -- the internet will cease to be stuck in glass. It will come alive, all around us, and that could be amazing. (Or, you know, the worst)."},

Deisimar sat on a bench in a park in Maicao, just inside Colombia, and wept as she told her story -- the story of Venezuela.Deisimar was born in an oil-rich, middle-class Venezuela. Then everything began to collapse at a pace reminiscent of Weimar Germany or Syria during the civil war.In the oil hub of Maracaibo, Deisimar's family lost electricity, reliable running water, health care and, finally, food. Venezuela's inflation may reach this year, the International Monetary Fund says, and some people root through garbage or eat rats to survive.\"We had no money to buy food, so I came here,\" Deisimar explained. Complicating the situation, she had become pregnant by her equally impoverished 18-year-old boyfriend. Contraception has become unavailable or unaffordable: A single condom now costs as much as a couple of pounds of rice and more than a tank of gas.\"I don't have enough to eat, so how could I pay for birth control?\" Deisimar asked me.She walks about selling medicines from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. each day. She eats at a soup kitchen when she can, but there are long lines because there are so many desperate Venezuelans here, with hundreds sleeping in the park each night.Deisimar hasn't been to a clinic for any prenatal care, and she doesn't know what will happen to her. \"Nobody in my family knows I'm pregnant,\" she said.After traveling along the border with , an aid group helping Venezuelans in this border region, I ache with stories from so many people like Deisimar. More than have fled their country so far, according to the United Nations, and millions more are expected to follow this year.American liberals sometimes sympathize with the Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, out of instinctive resistance to President Trump. Don't. Maduro has been a catastrophe for Venezuelans, and Trump is right to join Canada and more than 50 other countries in recognizing the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaido, as the legitimate leader of Venezuela.The problem is that Trump's saber-rattling backfires, helping Maduro by playing into a narrative of Yankee imperialism, and his politicization of humanitarian aid makes it less likely that starving people will actually be fed.Here's a three-part strategy that some other countries are already moving toward: Nudge Mexico () to play a more constructive role; work with Canada, Peru and Colombia to coax and coerce Venezuela's generals away from Maduro; and offer Maduro a comfortable retirement abroad if he steps down, versus a prison cell if he remains.Venezuelans overwhelmingly told me that they want tougher international action to dislodge Maduro. \"I lost my jobs because of sanctions,\" said Claritza Rojas, who used to work for P.D.V.S.A., the state oil company, and now is homeless in Maicao. \"They affect us, but pressure on Maduro is still good.\"Conditions may get worse, for the economy and health system are virtually . found that two-thirds of Venezuelans had lost weight -- an average of 25 pounds in a single year.\"Sometimes we went two or three days without eating anything,\" a mother, Anyi Coromoto, 25, told me, a day after arriving from Maracaibo with her son, Dylan. Coromoto is sticklike and weighs just 93 pounds. Dylan, 1 year old, weighs 11 pounds and was immediately hospitalized to save his life.In a world that has mostly treated migrants wretchedly, Colombia is playing a heroic role in providing such care. The country has admitted perhaps two million Venezuelans -- often allowing them to work, attend school and receive free health care. And ordinary Colombians routinely give food to hungry Venezuelans on the street; the world has much to learn from warmhearted Colombians.Still, the bureaucracy often doesn't work at the grass roots, and I found many Venezuelan children whom local schools refused to admit because they were already too crowded. In the city of Riohacha, I met a large extended family living in a parking lot, and none of the kids have been able to attend school.One girl's great-grandmother had been illiterate; the grandmother had gone to primary school and learned to read; and the mother had been to ninth grade. But because of the crisis in Venezuela and the difficulty attending school in Colombia, the girl, 12-year-old Yanethzy Sanchez, has not been to school for three years and can't read even simple words.Her 18-year-old sister died last year from pneumonia, and Yanethzy, once outgoing, is now herself fearful and withdrawn. \"She never leaves the parking lot,\" her mom fretted. It seems that she may never get an education, like others in Venezuela's lost generation.I asked Yanethzy if she could write her name. She couldn't. I asked her what three times four was; she looked blank. I tried another: What is four plus six?She looked at her feet and there was a long silence.

Her decision, widely discussed in German media, was interpreted as a symbolic gesture: a belated official rejection of an artist who yearned for Adolf Hitler's approval and thought that banishing Jews from the country was a good idea.One of the works, \"Breakers,\" from 1936, shows crashing dark green waves against a fiery evening sky; the other, from 1915, depicts a flower garden. The decision to remove them came just a week after Felix Kramer, an art historian and Nolde expert, questioned in a newspaper article whether \"the works of a committed Nazi are appropriate\" in the chancellery.Ms. Merkel said at a news conference last Thursday that she was returning the paintings to their owner, the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, because they were needed for an exhibition in Berlin. The show, \",\" opens at the Hamburger Bahnhof museum on Friday and runs through Sept. 15. It aims to dispel myths surrounding Nolde's career and art in the Third Reich.Since the end of World War II, Nolde has been cherished by a broad public for his radiant landscapes and vibrantly colored flowers. But Nolde's checkered biography has been whitewashed over the decades. Many Germans got to know Nolde as a victim of the Nazis; the exhibition will show that while his art was persecuted, the artist himself was not.The Berlin show is based on new research that only became possible after a change of leadership at the Ada and Emil Nolde Foundation, which the painter created to manage his archive and to run a museum of his work. Christian Ring, who took over in 2013 and is one of the curators of the Berlin exhibition, started to become aware that it had been involved in reputation-laundering during preparations for a 2014 retrospective in Frankfurt.He decided to open the archives, containing some 25,000 documents, to independent experts to conduct an examination of Nolde's life and work under the Nazis. \"It was time to put all our cards on the table,\" Mr. Ring said in an interview.Nolde was an ardent anti-Semite and a fanatical Nazi. Yet he was also condemned by the regime as a \"degenerate\" artist. After World War II, he embellished and dramatized his victimhood, and played down his complicity in his letters and interviews with journalists, and this was the story that caught on.When Hitler came to power in 1933, Nolde was 65 and established as one of the most successful artists of the Weimar Republic, celebrated as a pioneer of \"new German art.\" A swastika banner hung over his home near the Danish border in 1933, and Nolde joined the Nazi party in 1934. He hoped to be appointed an official state artist and had many fans in the upper ranks of the National Socialists. Yet he also faced accusations that his work was \"alien to the people,\" and Hitler hated it, describing him in 1933 as \"that pig Nolde.\"Nolde's work \"The Life of Christ\" was the centerpiece of the infamous 1937 \"Degenerate Art\" exhibition in Munich, mounted by the Nazis to defame and ridicule art considered \"un-German.\" In 1941, the Reich Chamber of Fine Arts imposed a requirement that Nolde had to have any sales or exhibitions authorized.In his memoirs, Nolde exaggerated and misrepresented the ban, saying he had been forbidden to paint at all, and that it was enforced by visits from the Gestapo. He called a series of small-format watercolors he produced toward the end of the war his \"Unpainted Pictures,\" and said they were studies for oil paintings that he had been prohibited from making.These myths took root and grew. After his death in 1956, the Nolde Foundation exhibited the \"Unpainted Pictures\" in a special room at the museum and excised anti-Semitic passages from new editions of his memoirs. In 1963, a book on the \"Unpainted Pictures\" by the eminent German art historian Werner Haftmann falsely claimed that Nolde turned away from Nazism in 1943.But the biggest boost to Nolde's image came with the 1968 publication of Siegfried Lenz's best-selling novel, \"The German Lesson,\" which is still required reading in German schools today. It centers on an artist called Max Ludwig Nansen, widely understood to be based on Nolde, who produces a series he calls \"invisible pictures\" when he is banned from painting by the Nazis.Particularly among the generation that grew up in the 1960s, embittered with their parents for enabling dictatorship and war, Lenz's novel elevated Nolde's \"Unpainted Pictures\" to symbols of heroic artistic resistance against a tyrannical regime. The foundation's museum was flooded with visitors.Until 2013, the Nolde Foundation \"remained wedded to the Nolde legend, the story that had been selling so well,\" said Bernhard Fulda, a Cambridge historian and one of the independent experts who examined the archive. \"In a way, the foundation had started to believe its own propaganda.\"The other expert, Aya Soika, a professor of art history at Bard College Berlin, recalled writing an email to the foundation in 2003, asking whether there were letters in the archive referring to an ugly incident in 1933, when Nolde incorrectly reported the artist Max Pechstein as a Jew to the Propaganda Ministry.The foundation never responded to Ms. Soika's request. But when she finally gained access to the archive in 2013, she discovered a file labeled \"E.N. and Jews.\" The document at the top was her unanswered email.The research by Mr. Fulda and Ms. Soika compelled the foundation to admit, in 2016, to \"errors of judgment in the past.\" Mr. Ring said he intended to digitize the entire archive and make it available online. He has also updated texts in the permanent exhibition at the museum to reflect the new research.Whether Ms. Merkel's decision to hand back her two paintings was motivated by the artist's unsavory past is unclear. Only one was required for the exhibition, but a spokesman told reporters that the chancellor would not take either one back after the show ends. Other paintings will be displayed instead.Mr. Kramer, the art historian who first questioned whether it was appropriate to hang Nolde works in the chancellery, said he thought it was the right decision. \"The chancellor's fast reaction speaks in her favor,\" he said in an interview.But Mr. Fulda wasn't so sure. \"If Angela Merkel had a picture of an eagle sitting on a swastika, we would say 'Whoa, what is going on?' \" he said. \"But with Nolde, it's very much a case of what you do with it. She could say to visitors, 'The German past is a complex one. There is guilt, there is complicity, there is looking away, there is beauty.' \"So perhaps Nolde succeeded in being a quintessentially German artist -- just not in the way he envisaged."},
{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/opinion/trump-minority-voters.html", "title": "Trump's Other Base", "authors": "Charles M. Blow", "contents": "Donald Trump's dogged, Captain-Ahab-like obsession with immigrants and asylum seekers crossing the southern border is many things.It is an open appeal to white-nationalist xenophobia among the many members of his overwhelmingly white base. Check.It is a frustration that his oft-promised new wall has yet to a single mile built. Check.It is a natural outgrowth of an intrinsic hostility to people who are Hispanics. Check.But I believe that it is also something more sophisticated and tactical than that: It is a play to the other, smaller part of his base, the black and Hispanic people who voted for him in 2016.Because Trump's path to victory was so impossibly narrow during the last election, and because he has done absolutely nothing to expand his base, he will need to hold on to all of the base he had.It is worth remembering that in 2016, after years of the racist birtherism attack against President Barack Obama, after calling Mexicans rapists and murderers and after promising over and over to build the wall, Trump still won 28 percent of the Hispanic vote, 27 percent of the Asian vote and 8 percent of the black vote, according to .(It is important to note that in the cases where data is available, more minority men voted for Trump than women. Among black men, 13 percent voted from Trump compared with only 4 percent among black women, and among Hispanic men, 32 percent voted for Trump compared with only 25 percent among Hispanic women.)Trump wants to hold these numbers if not inch up a percent or two.He has multiple strategies to do that among black people, especially black men. One was to have the spectacle of a black man, Kanye West, extolling Trump as a father figure who makes him feel like \"Superman\" because he \"didn't have a lot of male energy in my home.\"Another is to constantly remind black people, and the rest of America, that black unemployment is at a record low -- a decline that began under Obama, it must always be noted. Indeed, as an Associated Press Fact Check \"The most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under President Barack Obama, when it fell from a recession high of 16.8 percent in March 2010 to 7.8 percent in January 2017.\"But Trump still touted in February: \"African-American, Hispanic American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded.\" (As point of fact, black unemployment during Trump's tenure but has ticked back up.)Additionally, Trump signed the historic criminal justice , which was a set of prison and sentencing reforms. I personally don't think Trump cares much about criminal justice, particularly considering the way he has demeaned Black Lives Matter, demonized Colin Kaepernick and encouraged police brutality of crime suspects. But this was his son-in-law's pet issue and Trump loves nothing more than to say that he did something for minority communities that Obama didn't.There, you can see what the tent poles of Trump's re-election pitch will be to black voters. But he is also adding to that list his anti-immigrant stance, suggesting to black voters that the competition for low-wage jobs is a \"Hunger Games\"-type blood sport, that when immigrants arrive they diminish black people's economic prospects.As Trump in an Oval Office address after shutting the government down because Congress wouldn't fund the construction of his wall: \"All Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.\"That is a pitch to both blacks and Hispanics already in this country. There is a real cleavage between second-, third- and forth-generation Hispanics and new arrivals.My brother Marvin used to work as an accountant in the federal prison system. The institutions would regularly house groups separately, to avoid possible conflict. Two of those groups were Mexicans who had been in America for a while and Mexicans who were new arrivals. As my brother put it, a common refrain among the more established group was, \"They'll help you move a refrigerator for $5.\"As he understood it, it was all about the new arrivals causing embarrassment and being downward pressure on wages. This friction rings true to me and has existed among other groups of immigrants.During the first wave of the Great Migration of black people from the South to the North and West, some Northern black people were also afraid that the newcomers would upset the delicate balance that they thought they had achieved with white people.As Kelly Miller, the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the historically black Howard University, :\"Should the influx of negro laborers to the North, without proper restriction and control, be allowed to prejudice public opinion and thus reproduce Southern proscription in the Northern States, the last state of the race would be worse than the first.\"Add to this friction that although Americans often think of Hispanics as monolithic, they are anything but. Hispanics in America come from multiple countries and territories, some born abroad, others born here. Many of the asylum seekers at the border are from Central America. How Mexicans in California, Cubans in Florida or Puerto Ricans in New York feel about the influx may differ.Furthermore, we like to think of Hispanics as non-white, but Hispanic is an ethnicity, and Hispanics can identify as any color. Many Hispanics identify as white; they do so here and they do so in the home countries and territories. For instance, Puerto Rico is and nearly seven out of 10 people on the island identify as white.Also, the longer Hispanics are in the United States, the less they identify as Hispanic. Afound that while 97 percent of foreign-born Hispanics in America identify as Hispanic, only 50 percent of fourth-generation or higher Hispanics do.I believe that Trump's team, if not him, understands the fissures in this immigration debate and is using them.A found that 54 percent of blacks and 55 percent of Hispanics thought immigrants' illegal crossing of the border with Mexico was an important problem., Additionally, 31 percent of blacks and 40 percent of Hispanics believed in using the National Guard to patrol the border with Mexico, and 13 percent of blacks and 25 percent of Hispanics supported the building of Trump's wall. taken at the end of last month by Quinnipiac found that 10 percent of black voters and 29 percent of Hispanic voters said that they would definitely vote, or consider voting, for Trump in 2020. That's in line with 2016.And it would be a mistake to simply write off 2016 because minorities, particularly young black voters, were unhappy about Hillary Clinton's participation in championing the 1994 Crime Bill and because she used the phrase \"super predator.\"The front-runner among likely Democratic candidates is Joe Biden, a man who co-wrote the crime bill and was still when he was Obama's vice-presidential pick. Since then he has expressed regret.The front-runner among the declared candidates is Bernie Sanders, whose appeal among black voters last cycle was worrisomely weak and who shows some signs of having retained that weakness.As, Sanders held a rally in the gym of a century-old black church in North Charleston, S.C., last month. The room was packed, but, \"Of the more than 1,600 people who came to see the candidate, fewer than 40 were black.\"Democrats must attack the issue of black and Hispanic voters head-on and not as an afterthought. They can't go into 2020 thinking that the surge in voter turnout in the midterms is a ward against Trump holding the numbers of blacks and Hispanics he held in 2016. , 9 percent of blacks and 29 percent of Hispanics voted for Republicans, in line with Trump's 2016 results.White supremacy will use any tool at its disposal to survive.Frederick Douglass wrote in \"My Bondage and My Freedom\" that slave owners would often grant the enslaved relief from work during the Christmas holidays. But they would also encourage drunkenness and lasciviousness, and frown upon any slave who tried to put the time to productive use. This was psychological warfare.As Douglass put it: \"All the license allowed, appears to have no other object than to disgust the slaves with their temporary freedom, and to make them as glad to return to their work, as they were to leave it.\"If white supremacy will use celebration to disgust, it will most definitely use desperation to divide."}

It was longer than Prime Minister Theresa May had hoped for -- she proposed June 30, which many found unrealistic. European leaders agreed to review the arrangement at the end of June.At a news conference after a long night of negotiations, Donald Tusk, the European Council president, said the two sides had agreed to what he called \"a flexible extension.\" Britain will almost certainly have to hold elections for the European Parliament on May 23 -- something Mrs. May once argued would be absurd, given that Britons voted to leave almost three years ago. That prospect will likely anger hard-line Brexit supporters.The path ahead, as you've probably guessed, remains a minefield. Benjamin Netanyahu is on course to become With nearly all of the votes from Tuesday's election counted, the centrist Blue and White alliance led by his rival Benny Gantz conceded, all but confirming that the country will stay on its conservative course. Mr. Netanyahu is widely credited with having built a strong economy and kept Israel secure. He has also delivered long-sought diplomatic victories, several of them with the help of President Trump. Mr. Netanyahu, who is likely to be indicted on bribery and fraud charges, is expected to try to persuade his coalition partners to pass a law granting him immunity from prosecution. More than a million Israelis voted for Blue and White, a record for a new party, making it the main alternative to Israel's right wing.The election underscored that the than ever -- as is the chance that the United States will help create it. The Treasury Department said on Wednesday evening that it to hand over President Trump's tax returns, setting up a protracted legal battle between two branches of government.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a letter that lawyers needed more time to assess the lawfulness of the request, expressing concern that it would violate taxpayer privacy. It wasn't clear how long the review would take.Mr. Trump has declined to release his returns on the grounds that the I.R.S. was auditing him -- even though no law prevents a taxpayer from releasing returns while under audit. Mr. Mnuchin and many Republicans believe that furnishing the returns could open the floodgates to weaponizing the Internal Revenue Service. Some Democrats say the language in the formal request for the returns does not give Mr. Trump the leeway to refuse it.Astronomers captured the in the cosmos.A black hole is a cosmic abyss so deep that not even light can escape it.

Vogel", "contents": "WASHINGTON -- Lawyers for Gregory B. Craig, a White House counsel in the Obama administration, expect him to be indicted in the coming days on charges related to his work for the Russia-aligned government of Ukraine.The case against Mr. Craig, 74, stemmed from an initiated by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.An Ivy League-educated lawyer who held prominent positions in the Clinton and Obama administrations, Mr. Craig would become the first person who made his name in Democratic Party politics to be charged in a case linked to the special counsel's investigation.Mr. Craig would also become the first person to be charged in a case connected to the special counsel after Mr. Mueller finished his investigation into the 2016 presidential election. In a summary of the inquiry, Attorney General William P. Barr said that the special counsel's team had concluded that President Trump or his aides \"conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\"The case against Mr. Craig is related to the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, which the Justice Department is in part because of scrutiny related to Mr. Mueller's investigation.The law requires Americans to disclose detailed information about lobbying and public relations work for foreign governments and politicians, and it has been the basis for brought against investigated by the special counsel.Mr. Craig's lawyers do not necessarily expect him to be charged with violating the act.Rather, they expect him to be charged with making false statements to the Justice Department officials examining whether he was required to register under the law for work he did in 2012, while he was a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.The work, on behalf of the government of Viktor F. Yanukovych, then the president of Ukraine, was linked to Paul Manafort, who at the time was a political consultant earning tens of millions of dollars for his representation of Mr. Yanukovych.Mr. Manafort, who went on to become Mr. Trump's campaign chairman in 2016, was sentenced last month on charges brought by Mr. Mueller's team related to obstruction of justice and violations of FARA, as well as banking and tax laws stemming from his work in Ukraine.Mr. Manafort arranged for Skadden Arps to be paid more than $5.2 million in 2012 and 2013, primarily from a Ukrainian oligarch, to assist the Ukrainian Justice Ministry. Specifically, Mr. Craig and his team produced a report that Mr. Manafort intended to use to quell Western criticism of the prosecution and jailing by Mr. Yanukovych's government of one of his rivals, the former prime minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko, and to train Ukrainian prosecutors handling matters related to the case.After the report was released, and Mr. Craig was quoted discussing it in an , the Justice Department unit that oversees FARA reached out to Skadden Arps to ask why the firm and its lawyers had not registered as foreign agents for the Ukrainian government.The department initially concluded in 2013 that Skadden Arps was obligated to register. But it reversed itself the next year after Mr. Craig made the case that the law did not apply to his work on behalf of Ukraine.After the initial determination, Mr. Craig told the Justice Department that he and Skadden Arps did not proactively reach out to news outlets to disseminate and promote the report. Rather, he claimed he distributed the report only \"in response to requests from the media,\" according to a letter he sent to the department at the time.Prosecutors cast doubt on Mr. Craig's claim in a in January between the Justice Department and Skadden Arps. Under that settlement, the firm avoided prosecution in the matter in exchange for an agreement to pay $4.6 million, to retroactively register its Ukraine work under FARA, to beef up its compliance processes and to cooperate with government investigations of the work on behalf of Ukraine.But the settlement did not exonerate Mr. Craig, and in fact it signaled that he was in prosecutors' cross hairs. It quoted emails showing Mr. Craig reached out to a journalist to offer to provide the report and discuss it.Neither Mr. Craig nor the journalist are identified by name in the settlement. The journalist, David E. Sanger of The New York Times, is an author of .Mr. Craig's lawyers have argued that he was not required to register his work under FARA because he was not doing public relations for the Ukrainian government.In a statement on Wednesday, they said he \"repeatedly refused requests that he participate in Ukraine's media and lobbying campaign to promote the Tymoshenko Report.\"Rather, they say he spoke to The Times to correct the Ukrainian Justice Ministry's claims that the report cleared Mr. Yanukovych of accusations that he directed the prosecution of Ms. Tymoshenko for political purposes.The report \"was critical of the Tymoshenko trial and caused unhappiness in the Ministry of Justice,\" the lawyers said in their statement.Mr. Craig's lawyers asserted that the case against their client was flimsy, pointing out that Mr. Mueller's team to federal prosecutors in Manhattan last year for potential prosecution related to FARA, but that they did not bring charges. Instead, the case was .It is being handled by the United States attorney's office in Washington, and the Justice Department's National Security Division, which enforces FARA.Mr. Craig's lawyers said in the statement, \"We expect an indictment by the D.C. U.S. attorney's office at the request of the National Security Division.\" But they added, \"Mr. Craig is not guilty of any charge and the government's stubborn insistence on prosecuting Mr. Craig is a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion.\"Mr. Craig left Skadden Arps last year as scrutiny of his work with Mr. Manafort escalated and after a former associate of the firm to lying to investigators about his work on the effort."},

Barr said on Wednesday that he would scrutinize the F.B.I.'s investigation of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, including whether \"spying\" conducted by American intelligence agencies on the campaign's associates had been properly carried out.\"I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,\" Mr. Barr said during testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, adding that he wanted to look into both \"the genesis and the conduct\" of the F.B.I. inquiry. He cast his interest as a matter of protecting civil liberties from potential abuse by the government.\"I think spying did occur,\" Mr. Barr said. \"The question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I'm not suggesting that it wasn't adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.\"The remarks by the new attorney general -- particularly his embrace of the term spying, which is frequently invoked by critics of the Russia investigation -- are certain to please President Trump and his allies, who have accused American law enforcement officials of targeting his campaign out of political malice.Mr. Barr's pledge, made as he prepares to make public in coming days a redacted version of the special counsel's report on the Russia inquiry, was a sign that after nearly three years of investigating the president's campaign and Russia, the Justice Department's focus may begin to shift in a direction that Mr. Trump has demanded.In addition to Mr. Barr's review of the F.B.I. investigation, the Justice Department's inspector general, a specially tasked United States attorney and Republicans in Congress are all studying key actions taken during the course of the inquiry. Those actions include how officials opened the Trump-Russia investigation, , and obtained a secret warrant to wiretap a former Trump campaign adviser.Mr. Trump's thirst for a reckoning among his inquisitors appears to have only grown in recent weeks. Minutes before Mr. Barr took the witness stand on Wednesday, the president called the investigation an \"attempted coup\" and claimed, again, that he had been \"totally exonerated\" by the report, despite the fact that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who took over the F.B.I.'s Russia investigation in 2017, explicitly said he could not clear the president of trying to obstruct justice.\"It was an illegal investigation,\" Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a . In some of his harshest criticism of the investigation to date, Mr. Trump said: \"Everything about it was crooked -- every single thing about it. There were dirty cops. These were bad people.\"\"This was an attempted takedown of a president,\" he added. \"And we beat them. We beat them.\"Mr. Mueller to Mr. Barr late last month. Much of Wednesday's hearing, and an earlier session with House lawmakers on Tuesday, was focused on that report, on continuing redactions of delicate information before it becomes public, and on Mr. Barr's characterization of what Mr. Mueller found.Mr. Barr, who said that he hoped to make a redacted version of Mr. Mueller's report public next week, used more measured tones in describing the review he intended to oversee than Mr. Trump did. The attorney general also signaled that he would wait to hear from others already at work, including , before replicating their review.He said he was not starting an investigation into the F.B.I. or any other law enforcement agency, per se, but he did allude to several of the bureau's former leaders who oversaw the opening of the Russia inquiry.\"To the extent there were any issues at the F.B.I., I do not view it as a problem that is endemic to the F.B.I.,\" Mr. Barr said. \"I think there was probably failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon.\"Mr. Barr did not present evidence to back up his statement, and he declined to share details about which investigative actions concerned him.The F.B.I. obtained a secret surveillance warrant to spy on one former Trump aide, Carter Page, after he left the campaign. Republicans in Congress because it used unverified Democrat-funded opposition research compiled into a dossier by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer. But a judge approved it, and it was not clear whether any laws were broken.Both Dana Boente, now the F.B.I. general counsel, and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, signed the FISA renewal application on Mr. Page.The bureau sought the wiretap on Mr. Page because of his previous contacts with a Russian intelligence officer in 2013 and material in the dossier. Among claims that Mr. Steele compiled from sources was that during a visit to Moscow in July 2016, Mr. Page secretly met a Russian official promising compromising information about Hillary Clinton -- an accusation that Mr. Page has denied.The F.B.I. also used a confidential informant to collect information on Trump campaign associates, which prompted more accusations of spying by the president.Mr. Trump or people close to him have leveled charges that have not borne out, including that President Barack Obama had ordered wiretaps on Trump Tower in Manhattan.Defenders of the F.B.I. have objected to the notion that it spied on the Trump campaign. The F.B.I. and Justice Department, they say, waited to seek a court order permitting it to wiretap Mr. Page until after he left the campaign and was on the verge of returning to Russia.Still, the wiretap order enabled F.B.I. agents to obtain and read older emails in Mr. Page's account, including when he was working with the campaign. The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, has asked those involved in that effort why they did not use a so-called filter team to review the messages and screen out any sensitive but irrelevant information before adding them to the Russia investigation case file. However, there appeared to be no rule requiring such a step, according to a person familiar with the inquiry.The inspector general has also asked about the handling of F.B.I. informants, including Mr. Steele and Stefan A. Halper, an American academic who teaches in Britain.After the F.B.I. opened the Russia investigation in late July 2016, agents asked Mr. Halper to gather information on Mr. Page and George Papadopoulos, another former Trump campaign adviser.Mr. Halper had also spoken to Mr. Page at a symposium that month, which has raised suspicions by critics of the F.B.I. that the investigation started earlier than the bureau has said. But that earlier encounter was a coincidence, according to a former federal law enforcement official.Mr. Barr appeared to be responding generally to those episodes, many of which have been the subject of news reports.\"I feel I have an obligation to make sure that government power is not abused,\" he said. \"I think that is one of the principal roles of the attorney general.\"Democrats involved in Congress's investigations of Russia's election interference quickly chastised Mr. Barr for using the term spying in a way that they believe feeds a right-wing conspiracy of F.B.I. wrongdoing.Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said it appeared he was \"going off the rails\" to protect Mr. Trump.Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, accused Mr. Barr of giving \"a wink and a nod\" to a \"long-debunked 'spying' conspiracy.\"And at one point, Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, pressed Mr. Barr on whether he had \"specific evidence of anything improper in the counterintelligence investigation.\" Mr. Barr said he did not.\"I have no specific evidence that I would cite right now,\" he said. \"I do have questions about it.\"But when Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, asked Mr. Barr if he had intended to use the term spying -- a term the senator said might \"cause everybody in the cable news ecosystem to freak out\" -- Mr. Barr rephrased his statement.\"I'm not sure of all of the connotations of that word that you're referring to,\" the attorney general said, then he added, \"I want to make sure there was no unauthorized surveillance.\"Mr. Barr, who began his career at the C.I.A., did not intend to imply that spying was inherently wrong, according to a person who has discussed the matter with him but was not authorized to share their conversation. Mr. Barr sees no technical difference between that term and surveillance. He indicated that at issue was not the act of surveilling but whether officials followed proper procedures when they decided to gather intelligence on Trump's associates in 2016.Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, elicited a response from Mr. Barr that invoked another era. When she asked why Mr. Barr was going to review the origins of the Russia investigation, he answered that \"the generation I grew up in, which is the Vietnam War period, you know, people were all concerned about spying on antiwar people and so forth by the government.\""},

It is based on the she gave at Barnard College in New York last year that quickly went viral. \"If I could go back and tell my younger self one thing, it would be this: 'Abby, you were never Little Red Riding Hood; you were always the wolf,'\" she told graduates.Her book's release comes a month after the United States women's team filed a against the United States Soccer Federation.

Shear, Miriam Jordan, Manny Fernandez", "contents": "[]SAN YSIDRO, Calif. -- It was never like this before.The migrants come now in the middle of the night or in the bright light of day. Men and women arrive by the hundreds, caked with dirt, with teens and toddlers in tow. They jump the small fences in remote parts of Texas, and they gather on the hot pavement at the main border crossing in California. Tired and fearful, they look for the one thing that they pray will allow them to stay in the United States, at least for a while: a Border Patrol agent.Gone are the days when young, strong men waited on the Tijuana River levees for their chance to wade across the water, evade capture and find work for the summer. These days, thousands of people a day simply walk up to the border and surrender. Most of them are from Central America, seeking to escape from gang violence, sexual abuse, death threats and persistent poverty. The smugglers have told them they will be quickly released, as long as they bring a child, and that they will be allowed to remain in the United States for years while they pursue their asylum cases.The very nature of immigration to America changed after 2014, when families first began showing up in large numbers. The resulting crisis has overwhelmed a system unable to detain, care for and quickly decide the fate of tens of thousands of people who claim to be fleeing for their lives. For years, both political parties have tried -- and failed -- to overhaul the nation's immigration laws, mindful that someday the government would reach a breaking point.That moment has arrived. The country is now unable to provide either the necessary humanitarian relief for desperate migrants or even basic controls on the number and nature of who is entering the United States.The immigration courts now have more than 800,000 pending cases; each one takes an average of 700 days to process. And because laws and court rulings aimed at protecting children prohibit jailing young people for more than 20 days, families are often simply released. They are dropped off at downtown bus stations in places like Brownsville, Tex., where dozens last week sat on gray metal benches, most without money or even laces on their shoes, heading for destinations across the United States.At the current pace of nearly 100,000 migrants each month, officials say more than a million people will have tried to cross the border in a 12-month period. Some of those arriving today will have a strong legal case to stay under international refugee treaties and federal asylum laws, but most won't have a formal asylum hearing until 2021.The flow of migrant families has reached record levels, with February totals 560 percent above those for the same period last year. As many as 27,000 children are expected to cross the border and enter the immigration enforcement system in April alone. So crowded are border facilities that some of the nearly 3,500 migrants in custody in El Paso under a bridge, behind razor wire.In recent days, officials have grasped for ever-more-dire ways to describe the situation: \"operational emergency\"; \"unsustainable\"; \"systemwide meltdown.\"One top official said simply: \"The system is on fire.\"For President Trump, the situation at the border has generated red-hot fury. It erupted again on Sunday as he abruptly forced out Kirstjen Nielsen, his long-embattled homeland security secretary, for what he considered her failure to put an end to the surge of migrants.In recent days, the president has landed on a dark new message that, if taken literally, could mean an end to all immigration -- legal and illegal -- across the Mexican border. \"The system is full,\" the president said in California on Friday, standing in front of the rusting iron slats of the border wall that he wants to expand for hundreds of miles across the country's southern border. \"Whether it's asylum, whether it's anything you want, it's illegal immigration. We can't take you anymore.\"Yet, perversely, the president's own anti-immigrant rhetoric has helped supercharge the pipeline of migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Smugglers lately have been buying radio ads in Central America, warning that Mr. Trump is about to shut down all immigration. If you ever want to go to the United States, they say, go now! \"They said they would take us by bus. We would be safe,\" said Jeremias Pascoal, 16, who crossed into Texas earlier this month after paying $3,200 for a \"guide\" who showed his group to a road where he said they could surrender to the Border Patrol. Experts say the president is not wrong when he says that \"legal loopholes\" in America's immigration system are partly responsible for encouraging migrants to bring children like Jeremias on a dangerous journey that in some cases ends in tragedy. In December, in Customs and Border Protection custody after becoming gravely ill during their trip. Officials warn that .Christopher Cabrera, a vice president of the local union of Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas, pulled out his phone last week and scrolled through dozens of pictures he has taken out in the field: Groups of more than 100 people turning themselves in at night; seriously ill children huddled on the ground, being given medical aid.\"The majority of our agents get sick. Infectious disease is everywhere,\" Mr. Cabrera said, including in the Border Patrol's migrant processing center. \"There's always scabies in there. Usually we have chickenpox. We have tuberculosis in there. You name it, it's probably been through that building. So it's dangerous. It's dangerous for our agents. It's dangerous for the detainees that don't have anything.\"But the president has not chosen to prioritize a surge of new resources to the border, which could help ease the overcrowding and suffering that have gripped the migrants and the border communities where they arrive. Instead, Mr. Trump has insisted on simply trying to stop people from getting into the country in the first place -- a policy of deterrence that not only has failed but has made the problem worse.In an effort to send a \"you're not welcome\" message, the administration has tried a series of strategies: prosecuting everyone who crosses illegally, taking their children from them, tightening asylum standards, slowing down the number of people allowed to apply for asylum each day, forcing asylum applicants to remain in Mexico while they wait for court dates. In some cases, this approach has proved too cruel for the American public to tolerate and has run up against the protections enshrined in the Constitution, which the courts have decided protect migrants as well as citizens. Some of the president's agenda has been blocked by Congress or the courts. None of it has fixed the problem.To the contrary, these policies have from well-staffed border stations like the one in San Ysidro, Calif., where agents deliberately slowed down the number of migrants they would allow to cross each day, toward remote areas of West Texas and New Mexico, where the two migrant children died in December.And the administration has done little to speed up the immigration courts, though that could be just the deterrent the president has sought.\"The backlog has been allowed to build to the point of a crisis,\" said Doris Meissner, the immigration commissioner in the Clinton administration and now a fellow at the Migration Policy Institute. \"They do not accept the basic proposition that this is a population where there are people qualified for protection and that enabling the systems we have is an answer.\"In a series of international human rights agreements, beginning with the , nations agreed to allow anyone to seek asylum, even if they entered a country illegally. The agreements defined a refugee as someone with a well-founded fear of persecution based on \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" Determining whether an applicant receives asylum was left up to individual nations, but in the United States, the international obligations and the standards for asylum were largely incorporated into American immigration law beginning with the Refugee Act of 1980.Only about 20 percent of asylum seekers ultimately win the right to live and work in the United States by proving that they would face persecution in their home countries. Just wanting a better job doesn't qualify. Applicants have the burden to show evidence of past persecution or compelling testimony that establishes the \"well-founded\" fear that they would face danger if they return home.Some have won asylum, for example, by proving that their membership in a religious minority singles them out for harassment or threats. In the past, women suffering domestic abuse have qualified, as have some victims targeted by gangs. Generalized fear of violence does not qualify. Neither does poverty.Southwestern border apprehensions are on the rise after years of decline.A growing share of border crossers are from countries in Central America.100,000 apprehensionsper month on average100%OtherMexico48,672on average overthe last 12 monthsEl SalvadorHondurasGuatemalaOctober 2006March 20192007 fiscal year2018This year, a majority of them are children and individuals crossing with relatives.Many are seeking asylum, adding to the sharp rise in cases in recent years.100%200,000 asylum casesOther161,005Unaccompanied childrenIndividuals crossingin family units2013 fiscal year20192008 fiscal year2018Southwestern border apprehensions are on the rise after years of decline.100,000 apprehensionsper month on average48,672on average overthe last 12 monthsOctober 2006March 2019A growing share of border crossers are from countries in Central America.100%OtherMexicoEl SalvadorHondurasGuatemala2007 fiscal year2018This year, a majority of them are children and individuals crossing with relatives.100%OtherUnaccompanied childrenIndividuals crossingin family units2013 fiscal year2019Many are seeking asylum, adding to the sharp rise in cases in recent years.200,000 asylum cases161,0052008 fiscal year2018Sources: U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Department of Justice. | Note: Apprehensions are shown as a 12-month rolling average.By Denise LuThe asylum process begins with a \"credible fear\" screening to see if an applicant is likely to succeed in the first place.Out of nearly 100,000 credible fear interviews during the year that ended in September of 2018, an asylum officer confirmed a credible fear 74,677 times -- a nearly 75 percent approval rate. A senior Trump administration official vowed on Tuesday to dramatically reduce that rate by making the standards tougher. But it is what happens after the credible fear interview that is at the heart of America's bitter immigration debate.In 2017, 11,292 immigrants who had been released on bond or on their own recognizance were ordered deported because they failed to show up for their immigration proceedings, a 26 percent increase over the previous year, according to . Blanca Vasquez, who fled Honduras after gangs killed her husband and torched their home, passed a credible fear interview at the border in 2013. She was released and settled in northern Texas, where she got a janitorial job and waited for her day in court. About a year later, she said, she unintentionally missed her first hearing and was most likely ordered deported for failing to appear.She's not sure, because she stopped going to court at all. \"I got confused,\" she said. \"I ask God to look after me. There are too many problems in my country; I want to stay here.\"Maria Perez, a Honduran who joined a caravan with her 8-year-old son, Yunior, in November, waited two months in Tijuana for the chance to apply for asylum after her son's father was killed by a man who continued to threaten her family. When her number -- 1,506 -- was finally called, she and her son were soon released to await their court hearings under the juvenile protection laws. She lives now with a friend in Northern California, but she does not have a lawyer and isn't sure how to proceed with her case.\"I am very worried. I don't know what to do,\" she said.Families like Ms. Perez and her son are the biggest targets of Mr. Trump's fury. The president and his aides blame the nation's immigration laws -- the president derisively calls them \"Democrat laws\" -- for creating an incentive for migrants to bring a child with them to improve their chances of getting into the United States. One of them is the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, a 2008 bill signed into law by President George W. Bush that requires immigration authorities to treat migrant children differently than they do adults. The other is a 1997 legal settlement in a case known as Flores, which prevents the government from holding children or families in secure detention facilities for longer than 20 days.It was trying to get around those legal limits that prompted the administration last spring to begin forcibly separating migrant children from their parents -- detaining parents indefinitely while sending children to shelters and foster care. The fierce political backlash forced Mr. Trump to abandon that approach.The president's most recent initiative was the one calling for many migrants to remain in Mexico for the months or years it could take for an American judge to hear their case; that policy, too, when a federal judge in California blocked its implementation. For some migrants, the policy effectively meant no asylum case at all.Miguel Aquino, 29, who fled El Salvador in a caravan in October after being shot in the leg and hand by MS-13 gang members, waited for weeks in Tijuana to apply for asylum at the sprawling San Ysidro port, the biggest on the border. He was interviewed and sent back to Mexico to wait for a court date.In March, when he arrived for a preliminary hearing without an attorney, the judge gave him more time to find one -- and sent him back to Mexico to wait. Mr. Aquino said he has called eight lawyers, and they all said they couldn't represent him because he is in Tijuana. At this point, he is tired of waiting.\"The next time, if I don't go with a lawyer and they don't give a clear answer,\" he said, \"I'm going to look for another way to get in.\" Mr. Trump often says he plans to build a wall on the border with Mexico to halt illegal immigration. But when the standoff over funding for the wall led to a 35-day government shutdown in December and January, it actually made things worse. Many immigration judges were furloughed, and tens of thousands of deportation and asylum cases , in some cases for years. There is another problem with the wall: Slowing the exodus of migrants from Central America would need to start in those countries first.Central America's economies are still weak, and residents face drug and gang violence at levels largely unseen in other countries. Many are subject to deep poverty, a situation that recently reached a crisis with the collapse of coffee, corn and maize crops. M.C., a 23-year-old Guatemalan woman who asked to be identified by her initials for safety reasons, received an anonymous letter recently in her hometown, San Marcos, warning her that she would be killed if she did not give the letter writers 65,000 Guatemalan quetzals, nearly $8,500.M.C., who is three and a half months pregnant, went to the police in San Marcos. Then she got a second letter, warning her to never go to the police again. After she received a third letter, she made the decision to leave for the United States.\"I didn't want to come here at first, but then I think it's the best thing for the baby,\" M.C. said as she sat in a migrant shelter in the South Texas border city of Brownsville. \"Here, he's going to grow without crime. He can go to school.\"American diplomats say the best way to confront that kind of lawlessness is with the hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid that has been flowing to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras for several years, designed to bolster the rule of law and improve the economy.Last week, Mr. Trump abruptly abandoned those efforts, ordering the State Department to scrap about $500 million in aid to the three countries. Mr. Trump's decision has been criticized by members of both parties, who call it shortsighted.Likewise, critics say that Mr. Trump's repeated denigration of Mexico over the years -- including his insistence on building a border wall -- risks undermining Mexico's willingness to help to keep Central American migrants from traveling to the United States.\"This is the first Mexican administration that has even been oriented toward doing that,\" Ms. Meissner, the Clinton administration immigration commissioner, said. But blaming other countries and painting those coming across the border from Mexico as a national security threat has never failed to animate Mr. Trump's core supporters -- the ones who helped deliver him the White House in 2016.\"It's an invasion,\" Mr. Trump declared in February, after Congress denied him money to build a wall. \"We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.\"In fact, the migrants are mostly victims of the broken immigration system. They are not, by and large, killers, rapists or gang members. Most do not carry drugs. They have learned how to make asylum claims, just as the law allows them to do. And nearly all of them are scared -- of being shipped off to Mexico, separated from their children, sent to prison. Scared, especially, of going home."},

They want to have open borders.\"But Julian Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and a Democratic candidate for president, fired back at Mr. Trump, accusing him of using such talk as a political tool to energize his voters with dark threats about immigrants.\"It was predictable that he would start beating the drum of this again as he gets closer to re-election,\" Mr. Castro said in an interview. \"What I've noticed is that any time he gets into political hot water, he goes back to the issue of immigration to drum up support.\"Mr. Castro, who served as housing secretary in the Obama administration, is uniquely positioned to take on Mr. Trump on the immigration issue. The grandson of a Mexican immigrant, he is the only Latino candidate in the race for the Democratic nomination.As the sun set Wednesday evening, Mr. Castro held an immigration-focused rally of his own in San Antonio. His campaign had billed the event as an opportunity for the city, with its significant Mexican-American population, to show its resistance to Mr. Trump's immigration policy.Before a modest crowd, Mr. Castro denounced Mr. Trump's anti-immigrant message in no uncertain terms, calling the president's policies \"downright stupid.\"\"When it comes to immigration,\" Mr. Castro said, \"this president and his policies have been an absolute failure for our country.\"The president's decision to weigh in on the border was a clear signal that he did not intend to let the issue fade. At the fund-raiser, he told reporters that he wanted to call attention to a situation that he said has been ignored in the news media: the plight of migrants who cross illegally into the United States and then die of thirst or hunger.\"This doesn't come out in the fake news,\" Mr. Trump said as he recounted the stories about migrants that about a dozen donors told him. At Mr. Trump's urging, several of the donors described finding the bodies of migrants -- including pregnant women and children -- in the vast brush of their property.The president said he had never heard such stories of migrants dying, even from his top immigration and border patrol officials. In fact, immigrant advocates have for years documented the grim fate of some migrants who grow sick and die trying to make it into the United States. The advocates say Mr. Trump's policies have made the problem worse by limiting the number of migrants who can legally claim asylum at ports of entry, pushing more to cross at remote areas of the border.Several of the donors also told of how afraid they had felt when migrants from Central America, dressed in black, turned up at their homes.\"Dangerous people are coming here, and the good people are dying,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that the donors had all told him that the answer to the problem was to build the wall that has become the symbol of his approach to immigration.The president, who was joined at the round table with donors by Brad Parscale, his 2020 campaign manager, denied that the unscheduled remarks to reporters about the border were part of a campaign message. But immigration and border security has been a defining issue of his presidency. And Mr. Trump is betting that portraying the crisis that he says now exists on the Mexican border will be just as effective in his re-election campaign as the issue was in 2016.In the past several days, , his homeland security secretary, and for being too timid about shutting down the border and changing asylum rules to deny entry to migrants seeking protection in the United States.One of those officials, Ronald D. Vitiello, the acting chief of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, resigned on Wednesday after Mr. Trump pulled back his nomination for the permanent position, saying he wanted someone tougher. In a statement issued on her last day in office, Ms. Nielsen called Mr. Vitiello \"an unwavering advocate for the dedicated men and women who enforce our immigration laws.\"A top administration official said Tuesday that the staffing changes were meant to make way for more aggressive immigration actions..]But the president faces challenges of his own. His campaign promises have mostly gone unfulfilled. He has to build the along the southwestern border . And the recent surge of migrant families from Central America is a vivid demonstration of his inability to stop what he has called an \"invasion.\"There was also significant evidence during the 2018 midterm elections that the president's immigration attacks backfired in some Republican districts around the country. For example, several House Republicans, including some of the party's leaders in Congress, complained to Mr. Trump that his announcement right before the election that he was considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship might have cost several moderate Republicans their seats.And as he sets out for the re-election campaign, Mr. Trump is certain to face several challengers among the Democrats who are determined to make the president's immigration agenda a key part of their reason for running. In February, Beto O'Rourke, a former congressman from El Paso who has since declared his own candidacy for president, outlined his opposition to Mr. Trump's immigration policies at a rally held at the same time the president spoke in that Texas border city.\"We are not safe because of walls but in spite of walls,\" Mr. O'Rourke told supporters even as Mr. Trump was pressing to \"finish the wall.\"The dual candidacies of Mr. Castro and Mr. O'Rourke are almost certain to place Texas squarely at the center of the increasingly heated immigration debate.\"Texas is a Latino state, and we have two Texans on the ballot who are going to be turning out and galvanizing people from Texas,\" said Mayra Macias, a vice president of the Latino Victory Project. \"But it's also helping galvanize people, Latinos in particular, across the country because they are seeing these candidates talk about issues that affect us.\"But if immigration is at once a key campaign issue in Texas and other states, including California and Arizona, Republicans are betting that Mr. Trump's anti-immigrant message will also resonate far from the border."},

They agreed, however, to review the arrangement at the end of June to prevent British disruption to the bloc while the nation remains in Europe's departure lounge.Although the intense pressure of recent weeks may abate for now, the path ahead still resembles a minefield, dotted with explosive issues like a possible attempt to topple Mrs. May, a general election or a second Brexit referendum -- or some combination of the three. Most immediately, Mrs. May is likely to face calls to step down, and potential successors are already trying to raise money and advertise their credentials.At a news conference, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said that the two sides had agreed to what he called \"a flexible extension\" until Oct. 31, adding that this provided an \"additional six months for the U.K. to find the best possible solution.\" In essence, the bloc agreed to kick the Brexit can down the road for another six months.Mr. Tusk said that the Oct. 31 date was \"a bit shorter than I expected,\" but said that the extension should be enough to complete Brexit if London showed \"good will.\" He told the British: \"Please do not waste this time.\"But he did not rule out another extension. The June review, he said, was not for negotiation, but only to inform member states about the state of play in Britain.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker dismissed worries that Britain would interfere in the work of the bloc, saying that Britain's being \"a difficult partner\" was \"nothing new.\"Mrs. May said she knew that there was \"huge frustration\" at home that she had needed to request the extension. She appealed to lawmakers to support a Brexit agreement, adding that \"the choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear.\"But she can expect fierce criticism later on Thursday from her own lawmakers, many of whom opposed delaying Brexit to June, let alone October. Reminded of statements that she would not contemplate remaining in the bloc beyond June, Mrs. May said that the agreement allowed Britain to leave by then if Parliament approved a deal.The extension means that Britain will almost certainly have to hold elections for the European Parliament on May 23, something Mrs. May once argued would be absurd, almost three years after Britons voted for withdrawal. That prospect seems certain to anger hard-line Brexit supporters.President Emmanuel Macron of France called the October date \"the best compromise\" to maintain European unity. It's now \"up to Britons to be clear with themselves and their people,\" he said, about whether they want to participate in the European Parliament elections next month even though they would have to abandon the legislature a few months later.This was . Originally, she had promised Britons that she would strike a deal by March 29, only to acknowledge last month that the goal was impossible. Having missed that deadline, Mrs. May was a supplicant to the 27 other leaders of the bloc, who made their latest decision after she had left the room.Having lost control of the process in Brussels, Mrs. May will return to a pitched battle with pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers, including a significant number who now want her out and seem willing to risk an economically damaging departure without an agreement.Some have been arguing that Britain should use an extension to from the inside. While Mrs. May has promised not to do so, her position is so shaky that thoughts are turning to how a successor might behave, particularly a pro-Brexit hard-liner like Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary.At the same time, if Britain's Parliament should finally pass the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the bloc, then Brexit would take place on the first of the next month.European nations had been divided between those who wanted a shorter extension, to keep up pressure on Britain to resolve Brexit, and those who wanted to give it the time and space to reach a sensible conclusion.On Wednesday it was Mr. Macron who took the toughest line, arguing that Britain needed to propose a credible plan to resolve the crisis.On his insistence, plans to give Britain as much as another year were scrapped in favor of a shorter delay. He had argued that a long extension risked disrupting the bloc's more important work and that Britain's political confusion could prove contagious.But there was never any question of slamming the door instantly on Britain and triggering a disruptive \"no-deal\" Brexit that would have occurred Friday night in the absence of an extension. And Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany stressed the need for Britain to have time to manage an orderly process, which would allow for a good relationship between the two sides after the divorce.The October deadline was therefore a compromise, chosen in part because it would keep Britain outside the new European Commission, which will be formed in the fall.So far, the British Parliament has shown little indication that it will ever approve the withdrawal deal that Mrs. May negotiated with the European Union. That is a legally binding treaty that would resolve technical issues, like the government's outstanding financial commitments to the bloc, and keep Britain inside its economic structures until at least December 2020.After that point, Mrs. May wants to detach Britain from Europe's customs union and single market, and to take control of immigration from the Continent.That formula has been in Parliament and, despite with the opposition Labour Party, prospects for its passage still look low.More talks between the parties were scheduled for Thursday, but Labour has complained that Mrs. May has shown no sign of budging from her basic goal of taking Britain out of a customs union with the bloc.Were she to accept staying in a customs union, which is Labour's bedrock position, that would preclude Britain from forging trade deals on its own, defeating, in the minds of pro-Brexit lawmakers, the entire purpose of Brexit. Such a step would risk cabinet resignations and enrage the party faithful.In the coming weeks there may be more votes in Parliament to gauge opinion on various approaches to Brexit, but the possibility of assembling a sustainable majority for any one blueprint still seems remote.Conservative Brexit supporters are hoping they can replace Mrs. May with a hard-liner who could reopen the withdrawal agreement painfully negotiated over months with the European Union.But European officials emphasize that the withdrawal agreement, including a provision known as designed to guarantee no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, will not change. If Britain wants a managed Brexit, it must pass the withdrawal agreement first, they say: Only then can the European Union begin negotiations on a future relationship."},

It is a smoke ring framing a one-way portal to eternity.To capture the image, astronomers reached across intergalactic space to Messier 87, or M87, a giant galaxy in the constellation Virgo. There, a black hole several billion times more massive than the sun is unleashing a violent jet of energy some 5,000 light-years into space.The image offered a final, ringing affirmation of an idea so disturbing that even Einstein, from whose equations black holes emerged, was loath to accept it. If too much matter is crammed into one place, the cumulative force of gravity becomes overwhelming, and the place becomes an eternal trap. Here, according to Einstein's theory, matter, space and time come to an end and vanish like a dream.On Wednesday morning that dark vision became a visceral reality. As far as the team of astronomers could ascertain, the shape of the shadow is circular, as Einstein's theory predicts. The results were announced simultaneously at news conferences in Washington, D.C., and five other places around the world, befitting an international collaboration involving 200 members, nine telescopes and for the Astrophysical Journal Letters. When the image was put up on the screen in Washington, cheers and gasps, followed by applause, broke out in the room and throughout a universe of astrofans following the live-streamed event.Priyamvada Natarajan, an astrophysicist at Yale, said that Einstein must be delighted. \"His theory has just been stress-tested under conditions of extreme gravity, and looks to have held up.\" Kip Thorne, an astrophysicist at the California Institute of Technology, and who shared a Nobel Prize in 2017 for the discovery of gravitational waves from colliding black holes, wrote in an email: \"It is wonderful to see the nearly circular shadow of the black hole. There can be no doubt this really is a black hole at the center of M87, with no signs of deviations from general relativity.\"Janna Levin, a cosmologist and professor at Barnard College in New York, said, \"What a time to be alive.\" The image emerged from two years of computer analysis of observations from a network of radio antennas called the Event Horizon Telescope. In all, observed the galaxy in Virgo on and off for 10 days in April 2017. The telescope array also monitored a dim source of radio noise called Sagittarius A* (pronounced Sagittarius A-star), at the heart of our Milky Way galaxy. There, 26,000 light-years from Earth, and cloaked in interstellar dust and gas, lurks another black hole, with a mass of 4.1 million suns.The network is named after the edge of a black hole, the point of no return; beyond the event horizon, not even light can escape the black hole's gravitational pull.The mystery of black holes has tantalized astronomers for more than half a century. In the 1950s, astronomers with radio telescopes discovered that pearly, seemingly peaceful galaxies were spewing radio energy from their cores -- far more energy than would be produced by the ordinary thermonuclear engines that make stars shine. Perhaps, astrophysicists thought, the energy was being liberated by matter falling onto supermassive, dense objects -- later called black holes. Since then, scientists have devised detailed models of how this would work. As hot, dense gas swirls around the black hole, like water headed down a drain, the intense pressures and magnetic fields cause energy to squirt out the side. As a paradoxical result, supermassive black holes can be the most luminous objects in the universe.The images released today bolster the notion of violence perpetrated over cosmic scales, said Sera Markoff, an astrophysicist at the University of Amsterdam, and a member of the Event Horizon team. \"Black holes must be the most exotic major disrupters of cosmic order,\" she said.The unveiling today took place almost exactly a century after images of made Einstein famous and confirmed his theory of general relativity as the law of the cosmos. That theory ascribes gravity to the warping of space and time by matter and energy, much as a mattress sags under a sleeper.General relativity led to a new conception of the cosmos, in which space-time could quiver, bend, rip, expand, swirl like a mix-master and even disappear forever into the maw of a black hole.To Einstein's surprise, the equations indicated that when too much matter or energy was concentrated in one place, space-time could collapse, trapping matter and light in perpetuity. He disliked that idea, but the consensus today is that the universe is speckled with black holes furiously consuming everything around them.A planet-sized network of radio telescopes has assembled the first image of a black hole.Many are the gravitational tombstones of stars that burned up their fuel and collapsed. But others, hidden in the center of nearly every galaxy, are millions or billions of times more massive than the sun.Nobody knows how such behemoths of nothingness could have been assembled. Dense wrinkles in the primordial energies of the Big Bang? Monster runaway stars that collapsed and swallowed up their surroundings in the dawning years of the universe?Nor do scientists know what ultimately happens to whatever falls into a black hole, nor what forces reign at the center, where, theoretically, the density approaches infinity and smoke pours from nature's computer.Any lingering doubts about the reality of black holes dissolved three years ago when the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, detected through the fabric of space-time.Now the reality has a face. Peter Galison, a physicist, filmmaker and historian at Harvard, and a member of the Event Horizon team, noted that there is \"a wonderful open-ended sense of being able to see something\" instead of merely accumulating statistical evidence.Still, questions about gravity and the universe abound. \"We know there must be something more,\" Avery Broderick, a physicist at the University of Waterloo, in Ontario, told the audience in Washington, D.C. \"Black holes are one of the places to look for answers.\"Proving that the monsters in Virgo and the center of the Milky Way were really black holes required measuring the sizes of their shadows. That was no easy job. Both look exceedingly small from this distance, and resolving their tiny details would be a challenge for even the biggest individual telescope. Moreover, the view is blurred by the charged particles such as electrons and protons that fill interstellar space. \"It's like looking through frosted glass,\" said Dr. Doeleman, director of the Event Horizon Telescope.To see into the shadows, astronomers needed to be able to tune their radio telescope to shorter wavelengths. And they needed a bigger telescope.Enter the Event Horizon Telescope, the dream child of Dr. Doeleman. By combining data from radio telescopes as far apart as the South Pole, France, Chile and Hawaii, using a technique called very long baseline interferometry, Dr. Doeleman and his colleagues created a telescope as big as Earth itself, with the power to resolve details as small as an orange on the lunar surface.In April 2017, the network of eight telescopes, including the South Pole Telescope, synchronized by atomic clocks, stared at the two targets off and on for 10 days.For two years, the Event Horizon team reduced and collated the results. The data were too voluminous to transmit over the internet, so they were placed on hard disks and flown back to M.I.T.'s , in Westford, Mass., and the , in Bonn, Germany.The data from the South Pole could not arrive before December 2017, Dr. Doeleman said in an interview, \"because it was Antarctic winter, when nothing could go in or out.\"Last year the team divided into four groups to assemble images from the data dump. To stay objective and guard against bias, the teams had no contact with each other. They readied themselves for an inconclusive or ambiguous result -- a blur, perhaps, that they couldn't quite read.Dr. Doeleman grew optimistic last year at a dinner attended by some of the younger members of the team, who showed him the first data for M87. \"There were clear signatures of a ringlike structure,\" he said. After dinner, he went to his office and made some crude calculations. \"That was one of those great moments,\" he said. \"It was a surprise how clear this image is.\"As matter swirls into a black hole, it accretes into a disk just outside the abyss's edge. The ring of light in the new image corresponds to the innermost orbit of photons, the quantum particles that make up light. By laying a ruler across that ring, astronomers could measure the size of the black hole and see that it met Einstein's prescription. The measurement also gave a firm estimate of the mass of the Virgo black hole: 6.5 billion solar masses. That is heavier than most previous determinations, and it suggests that the masses of other big black holes may need to be revised upward. The observations also revealed that the accretion disk -- the doughnut of doom -- is on its side with regard to Earth, the hole facing us and spinning clockwise. The image is brighter where gas flows around the hole, toward us.Dr. Doeleman described the black hole in the center of the Milky Way as \"a fascinating, interesting object.\" But it is much smaller than the Virgo black hole, so its portrait is harder to capture. That task lies ahead for the Event Horizon Telescope.The telescope network continues to grow. In April 2018, a telescope in Greenland was added to the collaboration. Another observation run was made of the Milky Way and M87, and captured twice the amount of data gathered in 2017. That data was not part of the results released today, but will be used to confirm them and monitor the behavior of the black holes. Two more antennas are waiting to join the Event Horizon Telescope.\"The plan is to carry out these observations indefinitely and see how things change,\" said Dr. Doeleman, embarking on his new career as a tamer of extragalactic beasts.\"It's astonishing to think humans can turn the Earth into a telescope and see a black hole,\" and still more amazing to do it with this team, he said. \"That's the best.\""},

Deisimar sat on a bench in a park in Maicao, just inside Colombia, and wept as she told her story -- the story of Venezuela.Deisimar was born in an oil-rich, middle-class Venezuela. Then everything began to collapse at a pace reminiscent of Weimar Germany or Syria during the civil war.In the oil hub of Maracaibo, Deisimar's family lost electricity, reliable running water, health care and, finally, food. Venezuela's inflation may reach this year, the International Monetary Fund says, and some people root through garbage or eat rats to survive.\"We had no money to buy food, so I came here,\" Deisimar explained. Complicating the situation, she had become pregnant by her equally impoverished 18-year-old boyfriend. Contraception has become unavailable or unaffordable: A single condom now costs as much as a couple of pounds of rice and more than a tank of gas.\"I don't have enough to eat, so how could I pay for birth control?\" Deisimar asked me.She walks about selling medicines from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. each day. She eats at a soup kitchen when she can, but there are long lines because there are so many desperate Venezuelans here, with hundreds sleeping in the park each night.Deisimar hasn't been to a clinic for any prenatal care, and she doesn't know what will happen to her. \"Nobody in my family knows I'm pregnant,\" she said.After traveling along the border with , an aid group helping Venezuelans in this border region, I ache with stories from so many people like Deisimar. More than have fled their country so far, according to the United Nations, and millions more are expected to follow this year.American liberals sometimes sympathize with the Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, out of instinctive resistance to President Trump. Don't. Maduro has been a catastrophe for Venezuelans, and Trump is right to join Canada and more than 50 other countries in recognizing the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaido, as the legitimate leader of Venezuela.The problem is that Trump's saber-rattling backfires, helping Maduro by playing into a narrative of Yankee imperialism, and his politicization of humanitarian aid makes it less likely that starving people will actually be fed.Here's a three-part strategy that some other countries are already moving toward: Nudge Mexico () to play a more constructive role; work with Canada, Peru and Colombia to coax and coerce Venezuela's generals away from Maduro; and offer Maduro a comfortable retirement abroad if he steps down, versus a prison cell if he remains.Venezuelans overwhelmingly told me that they want tougher international action to dislodge Maduro. \"I lost my jobs because of sanctions,\" said Claritza Rojas, who used to work for P.D.V.S.A., the state oil company, and now is homeless in Maicao. \"They affect us, but pressure on Maduro is still good.\"Conditions may get worse, for the economy and health system are virtually . found that two-thirds of Venezuelans had lost weight -- an average of 25 pounds in a single year.\"Sometimes we went two or three days without eating anything,\" a mother, Anyi Coromoto, 25, told me, a day after arriving from Maracaibo with her son, Dylan. Coromoto is sticklike and weighs just 93 pounds. Dylan, 1 year old, weighs 11 pounds and was immediately hospitalized to save his life.In a world that has mostly treated migrants wretchedly, Colombia is playing a heroic role in providing such care. The country has admitted perhaps two million Venezuelans -- often allowing them to work, attend school and receive free health care. And ordinary Colombians routinely give food to hungry Venezuelans on the street; the world has much to learn from warmhearted Colombians.Still, the bureaucracy often doesn't work at the grass roots, and I found many Venezuelan children whom local schools refused to admit because they were already too crowded. In the city of Riohacha, I met a large extended family living in a parking lot, and none of the kids have been able to attend school.One girl's great-grandmother had been illiterate; the grandmother had gone to primary school and learned to read; and the mother had been to ninth grade. But because of the crisis in Venezuela and the difficulty attending school in Colombia, the girl, 12-year-old Yanethzy Sanchez, has not been to school for three years and can't read even simple words.Her 18-year-old sister died last year from pneumonia, and Yanethzy, once outgoing, is now herself fearful and withdrawn. \"She never leaves the parking lot,\" her mom fretted. It seems that she may never get an education, like others in Venezuela's lost generation.I asked Yanethzy if she could write her name. She couldn't. I asked her what three times four was; she looked blank. I tried another: What is four plus six?She looked at her feet and there was a long silence. Finally, embarrassed, she suggested in Spanish, \"16?\""},

Barr said on Wednesday that even after he released a partly blacked-out copy of the Mueller report, most likely next week, he would work to share with Congress some of the more sensitive information that he redacted.Mr. Barr also told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that while he intends to black out derogatory information about \"peripheral third parties,\" he would not take out criticisms of public office holders, including President Trump.Democrats have attacked Mr. Barr for on March 24 with what he called the report's \"bottom-line findings\": that the evidence the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, gathered did not show any conspiracy between Mr. Trump's associates and Russia, and that while the special counsel took no position on whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice, Mr. Barr deemed him cleared.Lawmakers have demanded to see the unredacted report, a request Mr. Barr tried to address on Wednesday.\"I intend to take up with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the chairmen and ranking members of each, what other areas they feel they have a need to have access to the information and see if I can work to accommodate that,\" Mr. Barr told the senators.His assurance did not mollify them. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, told him that any attempt to hide pieces of the report would \"only fuel suspicions that the Justice Department, which represents the United States, is playing the role of President Trump's defense team.\"Even while Mr. Barr sought to reassure lawmakers that he would treat the report in a transparent and fair manner, he also made a startling statement sure to please the president -- that investigative steps by the F.B.I. in 2016 to understand links between the Trump campaign and Russia amounted to \"spying\" on Mr. Trump's campaign, a portrayal law enforcement officials have vehemently denied.The attorney general was testifying about the Justice Department budget for the second straight day. But as happened on Tuesday, when he , questions about the Trump-Russia investigation led by Mr. Mueller and his still-secret full report dominated the hearing.Mr. Barr glancingly addressed a mystery raised by his March 24 letter, which did not explain why Mr. Mueller had rendered no judgment on whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice -- a silence that left open possibilities, including that the special counsel had wanted Mr. Barr to make the call, and that Mr. Mueller had intended for Congress to receive the evidence without the department weighing in.On Wednesday, Mr. Barr said that he had talked to Mr. Mueller about why he made no conclusion, and that the special counsel had not mentioned either of those possibilities to him. But the attorney general hinted that the answer might be known soon, saying that Mr. Mueller \"has a fuller explanation of that in the report that I'll be making available hopefully next week.\"Mr. Barr again declined to say whether he had recently briefed the White House on details of the report, even though Justice Department officials had previously said it had not been shown to the White House.The hearing also addressed criticism of the F.B.I.'s early decisions in 2016 to open a counterintelligence investigation into Russia's election-meddling operations that included scrutinizing any links between Russia and associates of the Trump campaign. The investigation, which Mr. Mueller took over the next spring, included assigning an informant to approach members of the Trump campaign with links to Russia and later obtaining a court order to wiretap a former Trump adviser with links to Russia after he left the campaign.During that part of the discussion, Mr. Barr used a startling word to describe those steps -- he said he thought \"spying\" on the Trump campaign had occurred. But he later seemed to tone down that formulation, saying his concern was whether \"illegal surveillance\" had taken place that was not \"adequately predicated\" -- and conceding that he had \"no specific evidence that I would cite right now.\"Responding to Mr. Barr's testimony, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, : \"These comments directly contradict what DOJ previously told us. I've asked DOJ to brief us immediately. In the meantime, the AG still owes us the full Mueller report.\"Meanwhile on Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a confirmation hearing for Jeffrey A. Rosen, whom Mr. Trump has nominated to be Mr. Barr's deputy. Mr. Rosen, who is currently the deputy secretary of transportation, would succeed Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr. Mueller.Mr. Rosen largely sidestepped questions about the Russia investigation and Mueller report, saying he was not part of the department yet and did not know the facts. But Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, noted that some criminal matters that developed from Mr. Mueller's work are continuing even though the Office of the Special Counsel is shutting down, and she pressed Mr. Rosen to commit to letting them proceed without political interference.\"If I am confirmed,\" Mr. Rosen replied, \"I would expect in all prosecutorial matters to proceed on the facts and the law and not any improper political influences.\"Ms. Klobuchar did not name which matters she had in mind, though several cases are still working their way through the court system, including the indictment of Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser to Mr. Trump.Separately, under questioning by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, Mr. Rosen defended his role in creating a Trump administration proposal on tailpipe pollution rules. Ms. Feinstein referred to that portrayed him as pushing to let cars emit more greenhouse gases. Mr. Rosen said the article had several errors, although he did not identify them.He also said the issue was how to carry out a law that required annual increases in fuel economy standards through 2020, and then set criteria for decisions about whether to require any further escalations in the years after that. The Trump administration, he said, was merely proposing a \"timeout\" after 2020.In fact, the current regulations, put forth by the Obama administration, require automakers to keep improving the fuel economy of passenger vehicles through 2025. The administration's preferred proposal would therefore allow more greenhouse gas pollution than current rules.Mr. Rosen also portrayed himself as playing a \"managerial\" role in overseeing the drafting of the rule, such as by ensuring deadlines were met.

Blow", "contents": "Donald Trump's dogged, Captain-Ahab-like obsession with immigrants and asylum seekers crossing the southern border is many things.It is an open appeal to white-nationalist xenophobia among the many members of his overwhelmingly white base. Check.It is a frustration that his oft-promised new wall has yet to a single mile built. Check.It is a natural outgrowth of an intrinsic hostility to people who are Hispanics. Check.But I believe that it is also something more sophisticated and tactical than that: It is a play to the other, smaller part of his base, the black and Hispanic people who voted for him in 2016.Because Trump's path to victory was so impossibly narrow during the last election, and because he has done absolutely nothing to expand his base, he will need to hold on to all of the base he had.It is worth remembering that in 2016, after years of the racist birtherism attack against President Barack Obama, after calling Mexicans rapists and murderers and after promising over and over to build the wall, Trump still won 28 percent of the Hispanic vote, 27 percent of the Asian vote and 8 percent of the black vote, according to .(It is important to note that in the cases where data is available, more minority men voted for Trump than women. Among black men, 13 percent voted from Trump compared with only 4 percent among black women, and among Hispanic men, 32 percent voted for Trump compared with only 25 percent among Hispanic women.)Trump wants to hold these numbers if not inch up a percent or two.He has multiple strategies to do that among black people, especially black men. One was to have the spectacle of a black man, Kanye West, extolling Trump as a father figure who makes him feel like \"Superman\" because he \"didn't have a lot of male energy in my home.\"Another is to constantly remind black people, and the rest of America, that black unemployment is at a record low -- a decline that began under Obama, it must always be noted. Indeed, as an Associated Press Fact Check \"The most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under President Barack Obama, when it fell from a recession high of 16.8 percent in March 2010 to 7.8 percent in January 2017.\"But Trump still touted in February: \"African-American, Hispanic American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded.\" (As point of fact, black unemployment during Trump's tenure but has ticked back up.)Additionally, Trump signed the historic criminal justice , which was a set of prison and sentencing reforms. I personally don't think Trump cares much about criminal justice, particularly considering the way he has demeaned Black Lives Matter, demonized Colin Kaepernick and encouraged police brutality of crime suspects. But this was his son-in-law's pet issue and Trump loves nothing more than to say that he did something for minority communities that Obama didn't.There, you can see what the tent poles of Trump's re-election pitch will be to black voters. But he is also adding to that list his anti-immigrant stance, suggesting to black voters that the competition for low-wage jobs is a \"Hunger Games\"-type blood sport, that when immigrants arrive they diminish black people's economic prospects.As Trump in an Oval Office address after shutting the government down because Congress wouldn't fund the construction of his wall: \"All Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.\"That is a pitch to both blacks and Hispanics already in this country. There is a real cleavage between second-, third- and forth-generation Hispanics and new arrivals.My brother Marvin used to work as an accountant in the federal prison system. The institutions would regularly house groups separately, to avoid possible conflict. Two of those groups were Mexicans who had been in America for a while and Mexicans who were new arrivals. As my brother put it, a common refrain among the more established group was, \"They'll help you move a refrigerator for $5.\"As he understood it, it was all about the new arrivals causing embarrassment and being downward pressure on wages. This friction rings true to me and has existed among other groups of immigrants.During the first wave of the Great Migration of black people from the South to the North and West, some Northern black people were also afraid that the newcomers would upset the delicate balance that they thought they had achieved with white people.As Kelly Miller, the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the historically black Howard University, :\"Should the influx of negro laborers to the North, without proper restriction and control, be allowed to prejudice public opinion and thus reproduce Southern proscription in the Northern States, the last state of the race would be worse than the first.\"Add to this friction that although Americans often think of Hispanics as monolithic, they are anything but. Hispanics in America come from multiple countries and territories, some born abroad, others born here. Many of the asylum seekers at the border are from Central America. How Mexicans in California, Cubans in Florida or Puerto Ricans in New York feel about the influx may differ.Furthermore, we like to think of Hispanics as non-white, but Hispanic is an ethnicity, and Hispanics can identify as any color. Many Hispanics identify as white; they do so here and they do so in the home countries and territories. For instance, Puerto Rico is and nearly seven out of 10 people on the island identify as white.Also, the longer Hispanics are in the United States, the less they identify as Hispanic. Afound that while 97 percent of foreign-born Hispanics in America identify as Hispanic, only 50 percent of fourth-generation or higher Hispanics do.I believe that Trump's team, if not him, understands the fissures in this immigration debate and is using them.A found that 54 percent of blacks and 55 percent of Hispanics thought immigrants' illegal crossing of the border with Mexico was an important problem., Additionally, 31 percent of blacks and 40 percent of Hispanics believed in using the National Guard to patrol the border with Mexico, and 13 percent of blacks and 25 percent of Hispanics supported the building of Trump's wall. taken at the end of last month by Quinnipiac found that 10 percent of black voters and 29 percent of Hispanic voters said that they would definitely vote, or consider voting, for Trump in 2020. That's in line with 2016.And it would be a mistake to simply write off 2016 because minorities, particularly young black voters, were unhappy about Hillary Clinton's participation in championing the 1994 Crime Bill and because she used the phrase \"super predator.\"The front-runner among likely Democratic candidates is Joe Biden, a man who co-wrote the crime bill and was still when he was Obama's vice-presidential pick. Since then he has expressed regret.The front-runner among the declared candidates is Bernie Sanders, whose appeal among black voters last cycle was worrisomely weak and who shows some signs of having retained that weakness.As, Sanders held a rally in the gym of a century-old black church in North Charleston, S.C., last month. The room was packed, but, \"Of the more than 1,600 people who came to see the candidate, fewer than 40 were black.\"Democrats must attack the issue of black and Hispanic voters head-on and not as an afterthought. They can't go into 2020 thinking that the surge in voter turnout in the midterms is a ward against Trump holding the numbers of blacks and Hispanics he held in 2016. , 9 percent of blacks and 29 percent of Hispanics voted for Republicans, in line with Trump's 2016 results.White supremacy will use any tool at its disposal to survive.Frederick Douglass wrote in \"My Bondage and My Freedom\" that slave owners would often grant the enslaved relief from work during the Christmas holidays. But they would also encourage drunkenness and lasciviousness, and frown upon any slave who tried to put the time to productive use. This was psychological warfare.As Douglass put it: \"All the license allowed, appears to have no other object than to disgust the slaves with their temporary freedom, and to make them as glad to return to their work, as they were to leave it.\"If white supremacy will use celebration to disgust, it will most definitely use desperation to divide."},
{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/opinion/game-of-thrones.html", "title": "Why We Need 'Game of Thrones'", "authors": "", "contents": "\"Game of Thrones\" returns on Sunday, and with it, the inevitable onslaught of \"winter is finally here\" memes and a sudden obsession with dragons, knights and internecine feudal politics. But the show isn't just warmed-over fantasy tropes. Its conflicts have become part of our public discourse, and Westeros, its fictional kingdom, has become an allegory for America.This isn't the first time a medieval fantasy has served this purpose. \"Lord of the Rings\" grew out of J.R.R. Tolkien's traumatic experiences as a soldier in World War I. It achieved widespread popularity in the United States during the 1960s and '70s, when hippies joked about electing the wise wizard Gandalf as president and wore \"Frodo Lives!\" buttons, an emblem of their solidarity with the idyllic, communal life of the Shire. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the massive multiplayer game \"World of Warcraft\" dominated the global gaming market. Its story of war between the orc-led Horde and human-led Alliance was set in an immersive, intricately detailed medieval fantasy world. J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels, in which the young heroes battle an evil wizard who perverts democracy, climbed the best-seller lists during the same period. Magic rules all of these realms, reducing complex social and political conflicts to battles over spells and ensorcellment.Whenever there's trouble in the land, it seems, our narrative appetites lead us backward in time, offering escape in tales of a world before modern statehood and techno-capitalism. But escapism isn't just a flight from reality. Ursula Le Guin, the celebrated fantasy author, once asked, \"If a soldier is imprisoned by the enemy, don't we consider it his duty to escape?\" She was writing about Tolkien, arguing that escapism in all its forms is a survival strategy, a way to think ourselves out of traps. In Ms. Le Guin's Earthsea novels, wizards craft magic out of words, trying to prevent a creeping global sickness by, in essence, telling the right story. If we think of fantasy as a way to escape from a dark fate, \"Game of Thrones\" is a skeleton key. In that case, what is the prison? And why does the path always seem to lead through the Middle Ages? One possible answer is that \"Game of Thrones\" is not actually about the past at all. It fits within a long tradition of books suggesting that our planet's distant future might look a lot like the distant past. This idea goes back generations. In Edgar Rice Burroughs's pulpy 1912 novella \"A Princess of Mars,\" a medieval Martian civilization is all that remains of a previously hyper-advanced, technologically sophisticated world. Jack Vance's wildly popular 1950s series \"Dying Earth\" imagined an earth so old that its sun is fading, the moon is gone and magic rules. More recently, David Mitchell's \"Cloud Atlas\" and N.K. Jemisin's \"Broken Earth\" trilogy hint that the far future might look very much like ancient history. Both authors describe worlds in which people have returned to Neolithic or medieval ways of life, largely because their civilizations have made catastrophic political and environmental mistakes.It isn't easy to imagine our distant future without fiction. We have computer models to forecast what centuries of climate change might do to the earth, and some vague notions of how this might transform our social and economic systems. But when the crisis at hand is about elections and economic recessions, it's hard to make decisions that take that faraway world into account. Perhaps \"Game of Thrones\" functions as a cultural reset button, inviting us to imagine how we might redo nationhood and industrialism if we had the chance. What if we could enter the modern era again, and do it right this time? Maybe this time, enlightened despots won't grind up the peasants in an endless war.That's why pseudo-historical stories are, oddly, the keys to thinking about what comes next for planet earth. Will our fortified border walls be all that remains after climate disaster? Or will we finally put aside political rivalries to save ourselves? We can explore our options while acknowledging the likelihood that we'll make mistakes.\"Game of Thrones\" feels relevant now, not simply because it allows us to speculate about which terrible real-life leader most resembles the sadistic King Joffrey, or see how climate change can blight the land with supernatural force. Like other medieval tales, \"Game of Thrones\" is not a precise allegory. Instead, it slakes our thirst for narratives that remind us that humanity will have a distant future, in whatever form it takes. We are building it right now.In the near future, as we face the increasing likelihood of catastrophe, we need to unleash our imagination. We will need it to find the escape route.

Nobody can take that away from Benjamin Netanyahu. This summer, in his fifth term, he will surpass David Ben-Gurion as the longest-serving Israeli prime minister. Enough said.His victory contains a warning for any Democrat still imagining that the 2020 election will bring an easy victory over Donald Trump. The Netanyahu playbook will be President Trump's next year. Gather nationalist and religious voters in your camp, add in a strong economy, dose with fear, sprinkle with strongman appeal, inject a dash of racism and victory is yours -- whatever indictments are looming.It's not that this happen. It happen, absent some decisive factor to upend the logic of it. Netanyahu is savvier than Trump, but they share a shrewd assessment of how to control and manipulate the politics of spectacle, as well as a fierce determination to stay out of jail. They campaign ugly.Exactly a century ago, Ben-Gurion said, \"Everyone sees the difficulty of relations between Jews and Arabs, but not everyone sees there is no solution to that question.\" Netanyahu's solution is by now clear. He is a true believer in Greater Israel and will not give up one inch of the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River. There will be no Palestinian state on his watch. Period.Many Israelis, weary of the chimera of a two-state peace, thank him for that -- as they thank him for a strong economy, Trump's support and a sense of stability. Netanyahu is a formidable politician adept in using hate and fear, the strongest currency in contemporary politics.His victory was personal but it was also structural. Israel now has a structural majority of the right. This will almost certainly enable Netanyahu to form a right-wing government, even though his Likud party appeared tied with the Blue and White party of his upstart challenger, Benny Gantz, each winning 35 seats.The Gantz performance was remarkable. It demonstrated the deep disquiet of liberal Israel over Netanyahu the King. But in the end Gantz took more votes from the left -- the Labor Party and Meretz -- than from the right. As Avi Scharf, editor of the English edition of the liberal daily Haaretz, put it to me, \"Israel's founding left is totally obliterated.\"The structural majority of the right is composed of the ultra-Orthodox, the settler movement, Mizrahi Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent, nationalists of various stripes and Russian immigrants like the one who recently told my friend Shlomo Avineri, a political scientist, \"I don't want to live under Putin, but I want my leader to be like Putin.\"Netanyahu never passes up a photo-op with Vladimir Putin, any more than he does with Trump. \"A different league,\" one of his campaign ads said. Netanyahu was able to project presence among the superpowers. His base loved it. Trump's base loves him, unswervingly. The president is not structurally assured of victory in 2020, but he is structurally within sight of it.That Netanyahu is facing indictment on bribery and other charges proved no obstacle to Likud increasing its seats to 35 from 30 in 2015. In the near term, Israeli politics -- and its democracy -- will hinge on Netanyahu's attempts to secure immunity from prosecution while in office. He may make acquiescence to such legislation a condition for coalition partners joining the government. It will not be pretty.\"We could see a coup d'etat against democracy, something very dangerous,\" Tom Segev, a prominent historian, told me.For now, Israelis seem prepared to shrug. The not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper conclusion to the Mueller report reinforced a feeling that the cloud of corruption that has hung around Netanyahu for years should not be taken as proof of it.In the longer term, Israeli politics will turn to the question of annexation. At the last minute, to shore up the right, Netanyahu promised to start annexing the West Bank if he won another term. The United Right and other extreme parties will not let him forget it.Still, there is no reason to take Netanyahu at his word. He made himself kosher with the Obama administration through his Bar Ilan speech of a decade ago supporting a Palestinian state, only to do nothing to favor one and everything to block one.Annexation could see the same fate because it's problematic. Netanyahu is happiest in the gray zone where Israel controls millions of Palestinians without having to confront the question of whether they vote or are granted Israeli citizenship. He does not want to jeopardize good relations with Egypt and the Saudis. He's quite happy with a Palestinian Authority in the West Bank that once saw itself in the role of leading the way to a Palestinian state but has become the feeble enabler of Israel's gray-zone domination.Netanyahu's annexation decision may hinge in the end on the long-incubated Trump plan for Israel-Palestine. It's said to exist. Maybe it really does. God knows. The fact that strong pushback from the United States on partial annexation is no longer assured says it all: The rightist nationalist wave has yet to crest."},

Peters", "contents": "WASHINGTON -- As a religious gay man who believes his party has ceded discussion of religion and spirituality to Republicans, Pete Buttigieg, a Democratic candidate for president, is talking about God and sexuality in an unconventional way: He is using the language of faith to confront the Christian right on territory they have long claimed as their own.Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has provoked a backlash from conservatives in the last few days after questioning the moral authority of evangelicals like Vice President Mike Pence who remain silent about President Trump's personal conduct yet disapprove of same-sex marriages and oppose gay rights.[]Though many conservatives were initially reticent to engage Mr. Buttigieg because they feared it would only add to his growing stature as a 2020 contender, they jumped on his latest comments. Some suggested he was attacking the vice president to further raise his profile. Others challenged Mr. Buttigieg's understanding of Christianity and accused him of smearing the religious convictions of the very people he wants to win over.A devoted Episcopalian who fluidly quotes Scripture and his husband, Chasten, in a church service last year, Mr. Buttigieg is making the argument that marriage is a \"moral issue.\" In a speech on Sunday to the Victory Fund, a group that supports gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender politicians, he said his relationship had made him \"more compassionate, more understanding, more self-aware and more decent.\"He then directly addressed Mr. Pence, as one man of faith talking to another: \"And yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God.\"This is not the domain where social conservatives and gay rights advocates are used to doing battle. In the decade and a half since same-sex marriage became a galvanizing issue for both sides, the national debate has largely focused on the tension between civil rights and individual freedoms.Mr. Buttigieg has reframed it in religious terms, raising questions about God, morality, sexuality and intolerance that depart from the familiar left-right fault lines. That quickly caught the attention of Republicans and conservative media commentators, who tried to cast his remarks as an unprovoked attack on faith-abiding Christians.Karen Pence, the vice president's wife, insisted Tuesday that her husband has no quarrel with Mr. Buttigieg. \"I don't think the vice president does have a problem with him,\" she in an interview with Fox News radio. \"I think in our country we need to understand you shouldn't be attacked for what your religious beliefs are,\" she added, noting that the speech was probably \"helping Pete to get some notoriety.\"Mr. Buttigieg, who has been mayor of South Bend since 2012, had a friendly working relationship with Mr. Pence while Mr. Pence was governor of Indiana. They toured factories together and occasionally exchanged text messages.But Mr. Buttigieg has cited Mr. Pence's support for legislation that made it easier for religious conservatives to refuse service to gay couples as a reason he decided to publicly in 2015.Mr. Pence's office responded to Mr. Buttigieg's comments this week by an old video clip in which he praised the mayor as a \"dedicated public servant and a patriot.\" Mr. Buttigieg's ramped-up attacks on Mr. Pence have miffed the vice president, who has privately told allies that if Mr. Buttigieg had questions about his religious beliefs, he could have asked him at any time during their friendship.The issue followed the vice president to the United Nations on Wednesday, where reporters shouted questions at him about whether being gay was a choice. Mr. Pence walked away without answering.The reaction from other conservatives was less measured. A Fox News host, Todd Starnes, accused the mayor of wanting \"to shove evangelical Christians into the closet.\"Erick Erickson, an evangelical blogger, said that Mr. Buttigieg's comments about religious conservatives who support Mr. Trump that he \"would be O.K. with using the government to persecute Christians.\" After Mr. Buttigieg spoke about his beliefs in an with USA Today, Mr. Erickson \"Mayor Pete Buttigieg Apparently Thinks Jesus Would Be Okay With Beastiality.\" (Mr. Buttigieg actually said nothing on that subject, though he did quote a favorite Bible verse: \"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others.\")Mr. Buttigieg has provoked a mixture of concern, derision and faint admiration from conservatives. Some built him up early as an undeniable but stealth force in the race. Rush Limbaugh warned his listeners that someone as articulate, personal and seemingly reasonable as Mr. Buttigieg would be a strong opponent. Ben Shapiro, the writer and podcast host, argued that he was the candidate who could most likely beat Mr. Trump. \"Really. He's not crazy, he's from the Rust Belt, he served in Afghanistan,\" Mr. Shapiro on Twitter.But this week provided a moment of clarity on the right, and the backlash was a reminder of how galvanizing religion and homosexuality can be when evangelicals and other conservatives of faith are convinced that their values are under attack. This sentiment, which was stoked by Mr. Trump and his allies in the Christian right in 2016, was a major factor in the president's huge margins with white evangelicals. Eighty-one percent voted for him, compared with 16 percent for Hillary Clinton.Indeed, if Mr. Buttigieg continues to gain in the polls, it could prompt the religious right to draw attention to numerous comments he has made about evangelicals and Mr. Trump -- \"the hypocrisy is unbelievable,\" he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" this week -- as conservatives did after Mrs. Clinton called Trump voters a \"basket of deplorables.\"Ralph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said Mr. Buttigieg's approach struck him as odd given how so much of his message has been focused on unity and restoring the Democratic Party's relationship with voters who are more religious and conservative. \"It seems to me the solution to that is not to attack the faith of anyone else, whether it is the president, the vice president or anyone else,\" Mr. Reed said. \"The solution should be to talk about their own faith.\"Mr. Buttigieg's words suggest that he will spend little effort trying to entice any of the president's most loyal religious supporters. But by pushing the discussion of homosexuality and marriage toward morality and the Bible, he is opening a door to voters of faith who are turned off by the dominance of the Republican Party's far right but are not yet convinced they could vote for a Democrat.That approach would be similar to the one Barack Obama took in 2008 when he received of the white evangelical vote. Mr. Trump's approval rating among white evangelicals has remained -- 69 percent as of January, according to the Pew Research Center. But that has slipped 9 points since his inauguration.Some evangelical Christians say that the fracture over Mr. Trump within their community runs so deep that the desire for an alternative -- especially one like Mr. Buttigieg, who is so temperamentally different from the profane, brash and unpredictable president -- will remain strong.Pete Wehner, an evangelical who worked in the George W. Bush White House and has split with his community and his party over Mr. Trump, said the way Mr. Buttigieg speaks with ease and familiarity about Christianity is a trait many voters will find to be a welcome contrast with the president.\"It's not a foreign language to him like it is to Donald Trump, so you're not going to get 'Two Corinthians' from him,\" Mr. Wehner said, referring to Mr. Trump's properly referred to as \"Second Corinthians.\"\"He speaks about faith in a way that is largely nonthreatening and not filled with anger,\" Mr. Wehner added. \"That is a real opening.\"But the unflagging devotion that most white evangelicals have for the president suggests that many will be far more concerned with policy results like conservative Supreme Court justices than with electing someone who speaks their language. The relevant question for Mr. Buttigieg is whether there is a critical mass of those who are wavering.\"Mayor Pete could not have hoped to capture conservative Christian voters or moderate Christian voters at any point in modern American history -- until now,\" said Jonathan Merritt, an evangelical author and speaker who disagrees with the decision by evangelical political leaders to stand by the president.Mr. Merritt, who believes the taint of hypocrisy has turned many young evangelicals like him away from traditional leaders, said he remembers growing up in the South when antipathy toward President Bill Clinton and his personal conduct was running hot.The line he remembers seeing and hearing over and over, he said, was \"character matters.\""},

Mr. Netanyahu has set a course that could end Palestinian chances for statehood, threaten Israel's democratic character and deepen the alienation between its right-wing coalition government and a majority of American Jews. Mr. Netanyahu can still choose to try to repair the damage from an ugly campaign. During an election night celebration, he promised to be \"the prime minister of all the citizens of Israel.\" We hope he will, although he has not governed that way up to now and has formed alliances with extreme right-wing parties., a centrist former military chief and Mr. Netanyahu's main rival, conceded defeat on Wednesday, paving the way for Mr. Netanyahu to become Israel's longest-serving leader.Still, forming a government is expected to take weeks of horse trading. In theory, a broad coalition based on Mr. Netanyahu's Likud party and Mr. Gantz's formed only a few weeks ago with two other military chiefs, could be the best option, forcing Mr. Netanyahu to compromise on his extreme policies. But analysts say it's far more likely he will stitch together a coalition that depends on ultra-Orthodox and ultranationalist parties, driving the government further to the right and worsening the country's political divide. One question hanging over Mr. Netanyahu's victory is involving donors and friendly media outlets. The scandal could cut short his tenure. On Mr. Netanyahu's watch, Israel has evolved into an economically vibrant, technologically innovative country that has improved ties to leading Arab states (even if the only peace agreements are still with Egypt and Jordan) and expanded a number of international relationships, including with Russia, China and India.Israel also is strong enough, either by itself or with the United States, to defeat any enemy. Yet its people remain fearful, especially of Iran.And some Israelis are even fearful of their fellow citizens who are Arabs. Mr. Netanyahu successfully exploited these fears to his political advantage.He has accelerated construction of thousands of new housing units for settlers in the West Bank and removed Arabs from their homes in East Jerusalem, steadily shrinking the land available for a Palestinian state.In a desperate bid to secure re-election, Mr. Netanyahu publicly aligned with a tiny party, or Jewish Power, led by followers of the extreme nationalist , the Brooklyn-born rabbi whose Kach party was outlawed in Israel in the 1980s and placed on the American list of terrorist groups in 1997. Otzma Yehudit advocates annexing the occupied territories, expelling \"enemies\" -- widely understood to mean Arabs -- and seizing the Temple Mount, a move tantamount to declaring war on Islam. Once Mr. Netanyahu crossed this line, perhaps it should not have been surprising that days before the voting he went even further and said he would begin effectively that are expected to be incorporated in any Palestinian state.Standing behind him in all this , who inserted himself on behalf of an Israeli leader in ways no previous American president has. Mr. Trump from Tel Aviv, recognized Israeli , that is the link with the Palestinians, and to the Palestinians in an apparent attempt to force them to abandon their dreams of an independent state.At a congressional hearing on Tuesday, -- he refused to publicly recommit the United States to a two-state solution and to say whether it opposes unilateral annexation of the West Bank.In the process, the United States and Israel have upended decades of American policy, United Nations Security Council resolutions and agreements like the 1993 Oslo Accords, which said the borders of Israel and Palestine, the future of Jerusalem, security arrangements and the fate of Palestinian refugees would be negotiated by the two parties.Under Mr. Netanyahu, Israel is on a trajectory to become what critics say will be an apartheid state like the former South Africa -- a country in which Palestinians will eventually be a majority, but without the rights of citizens. That's not good for Israel, nor for the United States., a former head of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, says his country refuses to confront a basic dilemma about what it wants to be in 40 years. He told The Times that the war most Israelis think they are fighting -- over the recognition, sovereignty and security of their state -- was actually won decades ago. The war now being fought is over expanding Israel's eastern border by building more settlements and demanding a Palestinian state alongside Israel.\"We are doing everything in order to create a virtual reality in which Palestinians cannot exist,\" Mr. Ayalon said. \"It is not a just war,\" he added. \"It will be a catastrophe if we should win. It is the end of our Zionist dream.\""},

Adultery is one of the crimes for which the archaic penalty is prescribed under the stern laws that went into effect on April 3 -- along with sex between men, abortion and rape -- and tabloids around the world have accumulated plenty of evidence against some Bruneian royals.Such royal hypocrisy may seem to be the norm among autocratic rulers sitting atop oceans of oil who place no limits on their own dissolute lifestyles and yet impose cruel Islamic law on their subjects. And tiny Brunei, a country roughly the size of Delaware that shares the island of Borneo with Malaysia and Indonesia, might not seem worth getting worked up about.Yet it is, for several reasons. First is that \"this is the way we do it\" is no longer a viable excuse for cruelty and barbarism anywhere. The world has gone way past times when witches were burned, homosexuals castrated or adulterers branded, and Brunei has signed (but not yet ratified) the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.Brunei's cruel, inhuman and degrading penalties are not a relic of history, like the sodomy laws that stayed on the books of American states well into the 20th century, but the whim of 72, who has ruled the Lilliputian nation since 1967 and ranks among the most ludicrously wealthy people on earth. He has long pushed his predominantly Muslim nation toward a conservative and restrictive form of Islam, and he first announced the new penalties -- which, in addition to death by stoning for gay male sex, include amputation for theft and 40 lashes for lesbian sex -- six years ago.An international outcry at that time prompted him to delay the laws. A similar outcry has accompanied their latest introduction: The United States, the European Union, Australia and others, as well as the United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, have all denounced the penalties, and celebrities including Elton John, Billie Jean King and Ellen DeGeneres called for , which include the Beverly Hills Hotel, the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles, the Dorchester in London and the Hotel Plaza Athenee in Paris.Besides the barbarity of the penalties, there is the danger that the law could nudge neighboring Islamic giants Malaysia and Indonesia toward tightening their own national or regional versions of Shariah laws targeting homosexuals. Conservative Muslim politicians in both countries were quick to . Beyond that, there is the fact that Sultan Hassanal enjoys his absolute dominion and his obscene treasure, including a gold-plated Rolls-Royce and a 1,788-room palace, because the world outside buys his oil. That gives his clients -- including Britain, Brunei's former colonial master -- a measure of responsibility and leverage.That celebrities are taking action is good, but governments and multinationals that do business with the wealthy sultanate have an obligation to look for ways to persuade Sultan Hassanal and other beneficiaries of Brunei's oil riches that they best quickly bring their laws into compliance with their human rights obligations and abandon vicious punishments for blameless behavior."},

Can New York Fix the B.Q.E.?", "authors": "Michael Kimmelman", "contents": "Sometimes life in New York can seem like an endless exercise in simply keeping bad from getting worse.Last week, crowds gathered in Brooklyn Heights to stick a collective finger in yet another crumbling dike, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Notoriously choked with traffic, a clattery, belching, potholed sluice of despair, built for 47,000 vehicles, now used by 153,000 cars and trucks a day, the long-neglected midcentury highway is collapsing. Experts -- in infrastructure terms, the day after tomorrow -- when big trucks may no longer be able to use it.Serving working stiffs from Staten Island, truck drivers from New Jersey, slicing smack through tony, litigious, brownstone Brooklyn, it is a modern American parable. Having bent the continent to our will, devising bridges and dams, railroads and highways, the United States in the early 21st century has fallen conspicuously behind other countries, paralyzed by our inability to fix failing infrastructure.We treat collapsing sewers and tunnels like trips to the dentist, procrastinating until disaster strikes, and then we have to spend a fortune on recovery. Faced with staggering costs, we squabble along partisan lines, pitting drivers against subway riders, suburbanites against city-dwellers, red versus blue -- blocking change in the name of prudence, missing one after another opportunity for progress.Summoned last week by community groups, the Brooklyn Heights Association and A Better Way, the crowd in Brooklyn Heights assembled for a town hall at lovely old Plymouth Church to help quash two nasty plans -- one painful, the other even more so -- that the city's forth a few months back.The for repairing the despised roadway, a crucial mile-and-a-half of which morphs into a six-lane triple-cantilever affair, clinging to the hillside beneath the Heights -- a kind of bunk-bed arrangement conceived during the 1940s by the prolific landscape architects Michael Rapuano and Gilmore Clarke.The cantilever system was a victory for People Power over the Establishment. It diverted the highway from running straight through the middle of Brooklyn Heights, as Robert Moses, the city's all-powerful planning czar back then, had wanted but community groups protested. The top bunk became the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, one of the loveliest spots in the whole city.Saving it is now inextricably linked to the destiny of the B.Q.E. Ideally, New York should leave the Promenade alone and probably just give up on this stretch of the expressway, the way other cities have torn down highways to create parks and flourishing neighborhoods -- the way the Bloomberg administration removed traffic from Broadway where it passes through Times Square.Drivers adapt. It's one of the counterintuitive laws of automotive behavior. We forget that car-centered urbanism didn't always have such a stranglehold on New York City. As late as the early 1950s, overnight street parking was illegal. Unfortunately, politicians and traffic engineers fixate on accommodating the number of drivers we have.And there seem to be more of them than ever, what with the subway's decline and hordes of Uber cars and Amazon delivery trucks.The solution, congestion pricing, may soon impose tolls to help fix the subways and reduce the number of cars and trucks on roads like the B.Q.E. A study released the other day by the Regional Plan Association -- commissioned by A Better Way -- suggested that congestion pricing could reduce traffic on the B.Q.E. into Manhattan by 13 percent, enough to allow the road to shrink down to four lanes. That's assuming politicians, catering to countless constituencies, don't exempt so many routes that congestion pricing becomes toothless.Some years ago, a B.Q.E. proposal surfaced that imagined digging a tunnel beneath Downtown Brooklyn to create a shortcut for the highway where it connected with the Brooklyn Bridge, reducing travel times and removing the entire cantilevered stretch past the Heights. It accommodated four lanes and looked attractive on paper. City officials say it will be as cataclysmic and complicated as Boston's Big Dig.Which is one explanation for the Department of Transportation's $4 billion plans. Choice A involved a decade or two of lane closings: total Carmageddon. Choice B turned the Promenade into a six-lane highway for nearly as long.As it happened, both plans were already pretty much shelved before the town hall meeting started. Mayor Bill de Blasio, reversing himself after several months, announced a \"\" would consider alternative proposals.There are a bunch of proposals out there now. One, by a Brooklyn planner named , a second elevated highway, a temporary parallel bypass, next to the cantilevered stretch of the B.Q.E.City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer has floated to close the B.Q.E. except to trucks, making one level of the elevated roadway a linear park. His likely opponent in the next mayoral race, City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, allying himself with many transportation advocates, wants to of highway with a more modest boulevard and spend the money that would have been used on its repair to improve public transit.Both politicians took to the Plymouth Church podium the other evening. The crowd cheered. But the most oohs and aahs came from the architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group, or BIG, which has an office in Dumbo. Cunningly labeled the BQP, for Brooklyn-Queens Park, BIG's plan has been quietly circulating among community leaders and transportation officials for a few weeks. It surfaced online and in The Daily News the day of the town hall.The plan moves the elevated B.Q.E. down to little-used Furman Street, which runs below the highway where it skirts Brooklyn Bridge Park. Furman would be widened by cutting into the berm now shielding the park from the highway. The berm, rebuilt, would then slide back over the new road, burying it -- at grade -- while making room above for the so-called BQX streetcar, if that were ever to happen, and also acres of new parkland.In essence, the elevated expressway would yield to a vast new wash of greenery extending Brooklyn Bridge Park all the way up to the Promenade.The benefits in terms of noise, air quality and open space are abundant. BIG says the disused cantilevers could be turned into more parkland or parking lots, revenue-generating shops or apartments, whatever Brooklynites wanted.Like the Clarke and Rapuano scheme, but for the 21st century, the BQP reframes an infrastructural headache as a civic opportunity. Back in 2011, the New York State Department of Transportation under Gov. Andrew Cuomo, clearly daunted by the challenge, simply fobbed off on the city the failing B.Q.E. -- which, as an interstate, was the state's responsibility. (The state can do that. It does this sort of thing all the time.)Mayor de Blasio then passed along the problem to Polly Trottenberg, the city's transportation commissioner, who has described fixing the elevated highway as \"the most challenging project not only in New York City, but arguably in the United States.\"To her credit she has now heard the outcry. She is open to other plans, BIG's included.There are many obstacles to the BQP and they are formidable. There is an immense sewer line that runs directly below Furman, serving much of Brooklyn.There are venting plants and substations for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that are in the way.One part of the plan imagines moving a lobby to the third floor of an occupied apartment building because the covered highway would abut the current entrance. Joralemon Street would become a dead end without any obvious place for cars to turn around.The list goes on.Brooklyn Bridge Park costs some $250,000 per acre per annum to maintain. It raises operating funds through private development. Brooklynites have spent years in court contesting even the smallest private incursions into the park. Unless the new parkland were financed differently, the added acreage via the BQP would require the construction of something along the lines of a brand-new 300,000 square foot condo or commercial development.Moses soured New Yorkers on big change. Resistance is the default mode. Whether the challenge is public housing, Hudson Yards, Penn Station or the B.Q.E., City Hall today doesn't seem to grasp the concept of urban design.The BQP sets a bar at least, which is worth pursuing. The mayor should do more than trust a panel of outside experts to judge what comes over the transom and offer quick solutions. The project needs state and federal buy-in. It requires a proper interagency master planning process, one steeped in community consultation. This takes time. And it can't be left up to traffic engineers.The crowd at Plymouth Church that arrived to man the barricades departed with the promise of something better.New Yorkers deserve as much."},

Edsall", "contents": "In the current election cycle, bets on moderation have few takers. Leading Democratic candidates are supporting bold progressive policy initiatives that are supported by liberal primary voters but may prove to be a tough sell to the general electorate. President Trump and his Republican allies will certainly try to use these initiatives against their Democratic rivals. They have in fact already begun to do so.A number of Democratic presidential candidates, for example, are calling for the of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and they have declared themselves in favor of such multibillion dollar programs as and a . Growing numbers of reparations to compensate black Americans for the costs of slavery and segregation.Why are these candidates willing to buck political tradition and heighten the risk of defeat on Nov. 3, 2020?Here is one answer, from , a political scientist at the University of Mississippi:Democrats contain much more heterogeneity across social groups than the more homogeneous white, Christian conservative Republican Party. To the extent the Democratic Party needs to entice and accommodate African-Americans, Latinos, environmentalists, etc. as voters, their candidates need to start embracing boutique policies for these groups that may not align with a general election \"median voter\" model of espousing moderate national policies.The issue of reparations illuminates the heterogeneity of the Democratic electorate. There are two surveys on reparations, a and a July 2018 poll by the liberal group . Both produced similar results.The Marist survey found overwhelming opposition among whites in response to the question As a way to make up for the harm caused by slavery and other forms of racial discrimination, do you think the United States should or should not pay reparations, that is, should or should not pay money to African-Americans who are descendants of slaves?Whites were opposed 81-15. Latinos were split, with 46 percent in support and 47 percent opposed. African-American voters support reparations, 58-35.The Data for Progress survey found sharp partisan divisions on the issue of reparations. Democrats supported reparations across the board: whites 37.8 to 30.5 percent; blacks 58.5 to 15.0 percent; Hispanics, 49.9 to 18.3 percent. Independents were opposed, 41.0 to 22.8 percent. Republicans were decisively in opposition, 77.1 to 8.9 percent.Among all voters, opposition to reparations was nearly twice as large as support, 47.1 to 26.4 percent.For the Democrats running for president, African-American backing is crucial both in the primaries and in the general election.Nationally, black voters in 2016 cast about in Democratic primaries. In four states, African-Americans cast the majority of votes: 71 percent in Mississippi, 61 percent in South Carolina, 54 percent in Alabama and 51 percent in Georgia.Let's look at another progressive initiative. In August 2018, voters if they support or oppose \"abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE?\" 41 percent opposed abolition and 24 percent supported it.Medicare for all and the Green New Deal pose a subtler dilemma for Democratic candidates. In the abstract, voters are supportive; the problems arise when the same voters are told key details, including costs.The best example of this is Medicare for all. In March, a found that a majority supported \"a national health plan or Medicare-for-all plan,\" 56-39, but support vacillates in both directions depending on how the program is portrayed.If, for example, Democrats posit that Medicare for all would eliminate health care premiums and reduce out of pocket costs, support rises to 67 percent with 30 percent opposed.Conversely, if Republicans succeed in portraying the program as leading to delays in getting medical treatment, or to the elimination of current private coverage, or to higher taxes, support collapses to the mid-20s and mid-30s, with opposition shooting up to the 60 to 70 percent range.Bold progressive stands may be risky in general elections, but recent research suggests that policy radicalism pays off in primaries.In a forthcoming paper, \",\" , a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, reports that voters in primary elections prefer candidates who are willing to take more extreme positions.\"Partisans are reacting most favorably toward ideological extremists,\" Lelkes wrote in an email:In fact, moderates are punished for the policies. Extreme politicians in the vein of Mike Lee and Elizabeth Warren, are rated roughly 20-25 points higher (on a 0 to 100 scale) by party identifiers than ideologically moderate politicians in the vein of Susan Collins and Joe Manchin. These effects are even larger among ideologically extreme respondents -- the kind that vote in primary elections.Lelkes conducted experiments that asked participants to rate a number of hypothetical candidates, including a moderate Democrat, an \"ideologically extreme\" liberal Democrat, a moderate Republican and an \"ideologically extreme\" conservative Republican.He found that the most ideologically committed voters -- who are disproportionately represented in primaries and caucuses -- strongly preferred more extreme candidates:The impact of policy cues was particularly strong among respondents who themselves held strong policy positions. If a respondent was told that candidate held extreme in-party views, ideologically extreme respondents registered ratings 35.89 points warmer than ideologically neutral respondents.Lelkes's conclusion?If we are to decrease affective polarization in the United States, we need politicians that are politically moderate. Unfortunately, voters prefer politicians of their own party that are politically extreme. This incentivizes extreme political candidates, which will only exacerbate current tensions.There are dangers for both parties is these trends, Lelkes argues, citing a 2015 study of House elections, \"\" by , a political scientist at Stanford.Hall found that when a more extreme candidate beats a moderate in the primarythe party's general-election vote share decreases on average by approximately 9--13 percentage points, and the probability that the party wins the seat decreases by 35--54 percentage points.Gallup data shows the steady ascendance within Democratic ranks of self-identified ideological liberals and a parallel decline in the share of Democrats who say they are moderate or conservative. From 1973 to 2018, as I have , the percentage of Democrats who say they are liberal from 25 to 51 percent, while the share of moderates has fallen from 48 to 31 percent, and the share of conservatives has dropped from 25 to 13 percent.A showed a steady process of ideological consolidation among both Republicans and Democrats since 1994, although consolidation accelerated most rapidly on the left:The share of Democrats who are liberal on all or most value dimensions has nearly doubled from just 30 percent in 1994 to 56 percent today. The share who are consistently liberal has quadrupled from just 5 percent to 23 percent over the past 20 years.In a reflection of their importance in primaries, \"consistently liberal\" Democrats turned out in elections at a 70 percent rate, compared with 47 percent for \"mostly liberal\" Democrats and 41 percent for Democrats with \"mixed views,\" according to Pew data.These and other trends, according to , a senior fellow at the liberal think tank, represent the changing the mind-set of the Democratic electorate. In an email, Drutman wrote:Two related dynamics are operative. One, Democratic voters have moved to the left in response to Trump, and are eager for policies that signal transformative change, not just incrementalism. There is no return to normalcy, because the past is now seen as more flawed.This dynamic has intensified because the most engaged Democrats, Drutman writes,have bought into an argument that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 because she was too incrementalist, and had she gone a little bolder and promised something more exciting than her competence and experience, she might have won.The second dynamic, Drutman continued, is thatin a crowded field, candidates are seeking to distinguish themselves with grass-roots energy. A very effective way of generating grass-roots energy is attaching to transformative changes these policies signal. Incrementalism and moderation doesn't generate much excitement among the activists or in coverage from journalists who are responsible for driving candidate buzz in these early stages.In a similar analysis, , a political scientist at George Washington University, argues thatOn race and immigration in particular, I think Trump is pushing Democrats to the left. To be clear, Hillary Clinton was already to Obama's left even in 2016. But I think Trump's rhetoric and agenda has made conservative positions on race and immigration even more anathema to Democrats.Sides also pointed out that the incentives for Democratic candidates have shifted:It used to be the case that Democratic candidates had to moderate on racial issues to maintain a Democratic coalition that included both blacks and some racially conservative whites. But the Democratic coalition has changed: it is increasingly made up of not only nonwhites but whites who espouse racially liberal attitudes.In an argument elaborating on a point made by Drutman, , a political scientist at Indiana University, made the case that the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton fostered the shift to the left:If a moderate policy agenda cannot guarantee electoral victory why downplay your leftward policy orientations in the unlikely event that it will jeopardize your electoral success?Carmines added:Trump's success has reinforced this perspective. He won with a very right-wing policy agenda. Perhaps a left-wing set of proposals can lead Democrats to similar success.Carmines believes that \"both of these premises are mistaken and could very well lead Democrats to electoral defeat when victory is within sight.\", a political scientist at Stony Brook University, argues that the liberal tilt of the Democratic candidates is, in fact, a rational political strategy. \"There is real change afoot with the most recent generations,\" she wrote, citing released in January:Young Republicans are especially different from older Republicans and the Democratic Party is likely to regard such findings as an invitation to poach more liberal young Republicans.Strong partisans, however, Huddy writes, \"are unlikely to defect from the party in 2020 regardless of its issue agenda,\" and political independentsare younger, on average, than partisans. Appealing to young voters thus makes political sense when it comes to the general 2020 presidential election., a political scientist at the University of California-San Diego, has a somewhat different take on the changing character of the Democratic electorate and the party's presidential candidates.The candidates, Jacobson wrote by email, \"are playing to their activist base whose enthusiasm helped produce their House victory in 2018.\"He warned, however, that \"leaning left does carry risks; there are not enough liberals (or progressives, if you prefer) to form a majority nationally or in the Electoral College.\"In contemporary presidential campaigns, according to Jacobson,the tricky thing is that in an era of extremely high party line voting, turnout becomes enormously important. Trump has proven to be a great mobilizer of Democrats, but they still have to consider how enthusiastic ordinary Democrats will be about their nominee.Trump, Jacobson noted, willtry to mobilize his base by ranting about \"socialism\" and of course some potential Democratic candidates will be more vulnerable to that charge than others.The strategic choices facing prospective Democratic nominees are, in the view of , a political scientist at U.C.L.A., even more complex and subtle than those described by Jacobson.Taking very liberal stands on contested issues, she wrote me,might not pose \"significant risks\" if you think your minimum winning coalition of voters is made up of people who either share your preferences on these things, or for whom these policies are not pivotal in their vote decision.She elaborated:There are people for whom these issues are important, but for whom there's no position a Democrat could take that would make them decide not to vote for that Democrat. There are other people, presumably, for whom these issues are so important and their preferences so intense, that any Democrat who takes a position far from their own is a Democrat for whom they won't vote. It depends which type of people you think are in your winning coalition as to whether you stake out positions on these things., a professor of communication, public policy and urban affairs at Northeastern and editor in chief of the journal Environmental Communication, addressed only the support for a Green New Deal by some Democratic candidates. His view is pessimistic.In an email, he wrote:The Green New Deal has done damage to the Democratic Party's chances heading into the 2020 elections, while hurting efforts to build momentum on behalf of climate and energy policy options capable of passing during an era of enduring divided government.In in the spring edition of Issues in Science and Technology, Nisbet contends that the goal of Green New Dealersis not to broker cross-alliances between the center-right, center-left, and left wing, drawing on the best ideas that those factions can offer, but rather to build progressive power.In an interesting development, the momentum behind the more radical Democratic agenda has turned both Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi into defenders of the party's old guard.Pelosi, who has been trying with mixed success to tamp down the left wing of the House Democratic caucus, recently on Medicare for all in an interview with The Washington Post.At first she said, \"I'm agnostic. Show me how you think you can get there.\" But then she cautioned:So we'll have hearings, again, let's see what it is. Right now it's a $30 trillion price tag. What do people get for that in terms of care, and what do they pay for that along the way?Implicit in her comment is the belief that $30 trillion is not acceptable to the American public.Obama, at a town hall in Germany earlier this month, warned of the dangers of uncompromising ideology for the progressive wing of his party:One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States -- maybe it's true here as well -- is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, 'Uh, I'm sorry, this is how it's going to be,' and then we start sometimes creating what's called a 'circular firing squad,' where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues. And when that happens, typically the overall effort and movement weakens.For the moment, both Obama and Pelosi are having minimal influence as far as the leftward thrust of the Democratic presidential nomination goes.Three years ago, Trump threw out conventional wisdom and went on to win the nomination and the presidency. Maybe, this time around, Democrats can gamble successfully on a similar strategy and win. Or maybe not. "},

For more than a year a deal that would put an end to the chaos deepening in Venezuela. But no solution is viable as long as the country remains tethered to Cuba. The communications minister and government representative in the talks, Jorge Rodriguez, reiterated Venezuela's desire that it receive the same treatment as Cuba. This declaration laid bare the pretension of the regime: a dictatorship that is accepted and ultimately gets its way, like the one Raul Castro inherited from his brother and passed on to Miguel Diaz-Canel.But Cuba is more than an inspiration and a role model for the Chavismo government. The island nation has hijacked Venezuela and is effectively holding it hostage. Important government decisions are being made in Havana, not in Caracas. The Castro regime's tentacles extend to several Venezuelan governmental institutions, including the armed forces and the offices of immigration and health services.In a speech at the United Nations in October, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, at least 22,000 Cubans have infiltrated Venezuela's government and its institutions. They have done so, he explained, holding important positions in government agencies and in the national security and intelligence services.In the past few years Mr. Maduro's regime has moved to consolidate power and dismantle democratic institutions. In the 2015 parliamentary elections, opposition parties , but Mr. Maduro of its powers. The next year, the regime illegally postponed regional elections and suspended the process of calling for a presidential referendum. In 2017, we took to the streets to protest the illegitimate against the National Assembly, and we chose to not participate in the rigged regional elections. Civilian demonstrations against Maduro's dictatorship that year left , thousands wounded and hundreds imprisoned. According to Foro Penal, a prominent Venezuelan human rights organization, 911 political prisoners are being held in Venezuela. In the past year, seven attempts by the military to re-establish the Constitution and our sovereignty, today partially controlled by Cuban leadership, have been aborted. More than 100 military officers have been imprisoned.In the mediated talks with the Maduro regime, conducted in the Dominican Republic, we sought to agree on conditions for presidential elections with democratic guarantees, but the regime refused an electoral process that reflected the will of the Venezuelan people. We declined to sign the agreement, and the talks dissolved on January 2018. For years the opposition has tried to negotiate with the regime to find a democratic solution to this mess. Instead, Mr. Maduro pushed on with a sham presidential election on May 20, 2018, which was not recognized by Venezuelans and many of the world's democracies. Mr. Maduro's approach echoes the Cuban model, where a single party rules and elections aren't competitive.The inextricable relationship between the Castro dictatorship and the Chavista regime began 25 years ago, when Hugo Chavez visited Havana just after being released from prison. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and set in motion the collapse of the Soviet Union, Fidel Castro's Cuba lost its great economic benefactor. Mr. Chavez's rise to power in Venezuela a decade later allowed Mr. Castro to find a replacement. The relationship between the two countries was cemented between 2004 and 2014, when Venezuela experienced an .The relationship has proved lucrative for the Cuban government. Between 40,000 and 50,000 barrels of Venezuelan oil , despite the fact that Venezuelan oil production has declined more than 60 percent in recent years. Venezuela's economic subsidy reached its peak at about of Cuba's gross domestic product. During the boom years, around 90,000 barrels of crude oil daily, representing $9 billion annually, were sent to Cuba. Some estimate that over approximately 15 years, Venezuela has subsidized $35 billion in oil to Cuba. The country was brought further into debt when Mr. Maduro bought and sent it to Cuba between 2017 and 2018. The problem, therefore, is not a potential invasion of Venezuela by a foreign power; for over a decade, Cuba has been a parasite, stripping us of our resources.But unlike Cuba, we are not an island. We have land borders, and our tragedy has spread throughout the region, adding pressure to neighboring countries. To stabilize the region and restore democracy, we must cut off the authoritarian germ rooted in Cuba and Venezuela. Democracy cannot be restored until the two regimes are decoupled.Mr. Maduro has shown that he will not leave power of his own volition. Those of us who oppose his rule are not armed, nor do we seek to oust his regime violently. We have offered amnesty but it has been rejected. However, we will never accept the normalization of this de facto dictatorship. As long as Mr. Maduro remains in power there will be more deaths, prisoners, persecution and compatriots forced to migrate. The international community has exhausted its diplomatic arsenal because there is no precedent in Latin America for a situation similar to that of Venezuela's. When it comes, Mr. Maduro's exit will be equivalent to the fall of the Berlin Wall for the region.It is a mistake to ask those seeking democracy in Venezuela to distance themselves from their United States and Latin American allies at this juncture. They represent the only opportunity to counterbalance a regime with unlimited power and no institutional oversight, that is armed and willing to exercise violence. Democratic countries must direct pressure toward Havana as well to bring about change in Venezuela.The call of the National Assembly and the country's acting president, Juan Guaido, for Venezuela to stop sending oil to Cuba is a first step. Companies trading with Venezuelan oil must comply if they want to avoid secondary sanctions derived from those already imposed against our state-owned oil and gas company, P.D.V.S.A., by the United States. For its part, the Lima Group must ensure that previously agreed-upon investigations into corruption and human rights violations are carried out, which could involve citizens of its countries, as well as Venezuelans and Cubans.Finally, the international left wing must understand that Venezuelans are not victims of a single dictatorship, but of two: Mr. Maduro's and Cuba's. They must withdraw their solidarity and support for Nicolas Maduro.Julio Borges was president of the National Assembly of Venezuela and is Juan Guaido's ambassador to the Lima Group.

{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/opinion/netanyahu-israel-election.html", "title": "Why Israel Still Loves Netanyahu", "authors": "Shmuel Rosner", "contents": "JERUSALEM -- There are more than a few reasons to dislike Benjamin Netanyahu. He can be smug and vindictive. He can be ruthless when going up against political enemies. He is likely to be indicted on corruption charges related to three separate cases, which, if they are accurate, indicate that he is greedy, vain and manipulative.And yet last night, this dislikable prime minister appears to have won his fifth -- yes, fifth! -- term in office. If he forms a government in the coming weeks, as he is expected to, Mr. Netanyahu will surpass Israel's founder David Ben Gurion as the country's longest serving prime minister. How is this possible?To be fair, this was a close race. The main opposition party, Blue and White, is expected to get as many seats in the Knesset as Mr. Netanyahu's Likud party. The coalition that he forms will probably have little more than the minimum 61 seats behind it.Given Mr. Netanyahu's unsavory qualities, many people were intent on defeating him. Just a few months ahead of the election, Blue and White, a new centrist alliance led by three decorated generals and a former security minister, came together with little purpose other than to present an alternative to Mr. Netanyahu, who has been in power since 2009. They campaigned fiercely -- but civilly. At rallies, General Benny Gantz, the head of Blue and White, made it a habit to thank the prime minister for his service to the nation; this was a mirror image of Mr. Netanyahu's and Likud's name-calling and personal attacks. But civility and centrism weren't enough to carry the day.Mr. Netanyahu may be cynical but he doesn't rig elections. He wins fairly, often against great odds, including, this time, the coming indictments against him and an understandable fatigue with his decade-old leadership, not to mention various other inter- and intraparty squabbles. But he seems to have succeeded again this time for the same reason he has dominated Israeli politics for most of the past 25 years: because when it comes to Israel's national security, he is a leader with strategy and vision. And that is what many voters want.In the mid-1990s, during his first term as prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu rejected the assumptions underlying the peace process with the Palestinians. At the time this was considered daringly right wing. Today, it is considered common sense in Israel, including by Mr. Netanyahu's political rivals. Likewise, Mr. Netanyahu was one of the first politicians to recognize Iran as the main threat to Israel's survival, and fought fiercely in international forums to get the world's attention to this problem. Today, this view is also widely appreciated across the Israeli political spectrum.The list goes on: In 2005, he warned that withdrawing Israeli troops from Gaza would end in disaster -- and it did. He successfully resisted eight years of the Obama administration's pressure to offer concessions to the Palestinians. He quickly forged an alliance with President Trump that has already proved to be of great benefit to Israel. In two years, Mr. Trump has moved the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, withdrawn from the nuclear agreement with Iran, recognized Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and on Monday, designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization.Blue and White tried to make this election a referendum on Mr. Netanyahu. Its campaign focused largely on the prime minister's personal failings, the corruption accusations against him, and exhaustion with his leadership. But in Israel, security trumps all other issues. ( found voters rated security as their No. 1 concern.)Blue and White thought that by placing former Israel Defense Forces chiefs of staff at the top of the party list, it could counter Mr. Netanyahu's image and experience as a defender of Israel, diplomatically and militarily. But the public still showed that it trusts the incumbent more.Has Mr. Netanyahu ever been wrong when it comes to security? The truth is, many Israelis will find it hard to think of an example. And this goes not just for voters for the Likud party, or even the right-wing parties that are expected to join Likud in the next government, but even for Blue and White, which largely echoed Mr. Netanyahu's positions on important foreign policy and national security questions.Those Israelis who do want Mr. Netanyahu gone -- and yes, there are many -- want him gone because of his personality, his coarsening of Israeli political discourse, his pettiness and, maybe, his corruption. Those Israelis who want Mr. Netanyahu to stay -- and the election makes clear that there are many -- want him to stay despite those same characteristics. They can forgive the prime minister for often being a small man, because they appreciate him as a great leader."},

", "authors": "Farhad Manjoo", "contents": "A few months ago, I stumbled onto a new way of writing. I don't mean an unusual literary or textual style; I mean a new physical method for the painstaking task of chiseling the formless geologic schists inside my brain into words and sentences crisp and coherent enough to please at least a few of my fellow human beings.Here's what I do: Instead of writing, I speak. When a notable thought strikes me -- I could be pacing around my home office, washing dishes, driving or, most often recently, taking long, aimless strolls on desolate suburban Silicon Valley sidewalks -- I open , a cloud-connected voice-recording app on my phone. Because I'm pretty much always wearing wireless headphones with a mic -- yes, I'm one of those AirPod people -- the app records my voice in high fidelity as I walk, while my phone is snug in my pocket or otherwise out of sight.And so, on foot, wandering about town, I write. I began making voice memos to remember column ideas and short turns of phrases. But as I became comfortable with the practice, I started to compose full sentences, paragraphs and even whole outlines of my columns just by speaking.Then comes the magical part. Every few days, I load the recordings into , an app that bills itself as a \"word processor for audio.\" Some of my voice memos are more than an hour long, but Descript quickly (and cheaply) transcribes the text, truncates the silences and renders my speech editable and searchable. Through software, my meandering memos are turned into a skeleton of writing. The text Descript spits out is not by any means ready for publication, but it functions like a pencil sketch: a rough first draft that I then hammer into life the old-fashioned way, on a screen, with a keyboard, lots of tears and not a little blood.Writing by speaking has quietly revolutionized how I work. It has made my writing more conversational and less precious. More amazingly, it has expanded my canvas: I can now write the way street photographers shoot -- out in the world, whenever the muse strikes me (or more likely, when I'm loafing around, procrastinating on some other piece of writing). Most of my recent columns, including large portions of this one, were written this way: first by mouth, not fingers.There is something more interesting here than a newspaper columnist's life hack. I began writing-by-speaking as part of a deeper exploration into living inside what I call the \"screenless internet\" -- which may well become the internet of tomorrow, for better and worse.Late last decade, smartphones liberated computers from our desks, which was thrilling until we realized they were also shackling us into a distracted, addictive . Now, as we reach , it is becoming possible to see the outlines of a less visually arresting path ahead.New advances -- like smarter and more ubiquitous voice assistants; better text-to-speech synthesis; easy-to-use audio and video production apps like Descript and ; and gadgets that burrow the internet into your ears, like Apple's AirPods and -- point to a profound shift in computing. Soon it might be possible to conduct a large slice of digital life, including work, without being glued to a screen. What will that be like? In what ways will it be better than what we have today -- and in what ways worse?To begin to understand these questions, I've been trying to live without screens. Two or three mornings a week, I'll put on my headphones and some comfortable walking boots (Docs and Timbs are my go-to), then I'll head out to the beaten sidewalk. My aim is to see how much I can get done with my mouth and my ears, to understand how interacting with computers mostly by speaking and listening might change computing, and how it might change us.Now, I'll grant that my \"work\" is unnatural and a little bizarre. Still, I was surprised at how much of it can be done without a screen. As a columnist, I spend large chunks of the day ingesting and analyzing information. I'll read the news, read magazines and books, and try to find sources and experts to talk about whatever I find interesting.At my office, I'd do all of this on a screen. But I can now find just as much news and expertise on the screenless internet. Indeed, in many ways, screenless content is better. Podcasts and audiobooks offer the sort of intimate peek at expertise that I remember from the amateur blogosphere circa 2003: a nuanced, serious, ongoing conversation about the news, one that feels more intimate, less clickbaity and less reflexively partisan than today's visual web. And it's efficient, too. Listening on double-speed, I can power through news and audiobooks in no time, and without distraction. When information is coming through my ears, I feel less anxiety to constantly look for something new, the way we are encouraged to do on the pull-down-for-more touch-screen internet of today.There are readers who'll say this experiment sounds silly, that the pull of screens is so strong it is folly to imagine a world without them. Others might suggest that the screenless internet, if it comes, will bring its own peculiar horrors: Picture dead-eyed AirPodders mumbling incantations to robotic assistants as they amble zombielike through Times Square (directed by Jordan Peele).I'm wary of such dangers (and others yet to be imagined). Yet the more I write by speaking, the more hopelessly I fall for a screenless future. The bottom line, for me, is how magically even my jury-rigged method collapses the distance between my thoughts and the computer.As this distance collapses further -- as computers begin to understand our speech and then our thoughts with high fidelity -- the internet will cease to be stuck in glass. It will come alive, all around us, and that could be amazing. (Or, you know, the worst)."},
{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/opinion/netanyahu-trump-israel-election.html", "title": "Bibi Trump and Donald Netanyahu", "authors": "Thomas L. Friedman", "contents": "There are two countries that I've been professionally, emotionally and intellectually involved with my entire journalism career -- the United States and Israel. I've never been more worried about both, because President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are essentially the same person, and they pose the same threat to their respective nations.They are both men utterly without shame, backed by parties utterly without spine, protected by big media outlets utterly without integrity. They are both funded by a Las Vegas casino magnate, Sheldon Adelson. They are both making support for Israel a \"Republican'' cause -- no longer a bipartisan one. And they each could shoot an innocent man in broad daylight in the middle of Fifth Avenue and their supporters would say the victim had it coming.As a result, they are each free to cross red lines that their predecessors never dared to. Which is why I believe that four more years of Netanyahu, which is almost certain after Israel's election on Tuesday, and six more years of Trump, which is a real possibility, will hasten the emergence of an America and an Israel where respect for civility, democracy, an independent judiciary and independent media are no longer examples for others to follow. Instead, both countries will be cautionary tales of how precious are the norms and institutions that bind a democracy, and how easily they can be undermined by leaders who will tell any lie, smear any competitor and wink at any extremist to stay in power.Netanyahu's first order of business will be to strike an agreement with his potential coalition partners, most of them far-right, pro-settler parties, in which, as Haaretz reported, those parties will agree to create legislation that gets rid of the multiple indictments for corruption looming in Bibi's future -- and in return he will agree to annex West Bank settlements to Israel. And Trump will somehow go along, maybe as part of his own peace plan. It is going to be a dirty business, for sure.But what else could we expect? The parallels between Trump and Netanyahu are now deep and broad.Bibi has openly embraced a racist, anti-Arab Israeli party and racist, anti-Arab rhetoric, unlike any previous Israeli prime minister. At the same time, he has steadily been erasing the Green Line that separated Israel from the West Bank and its 2.5 million Palestinians -- with the help of Trump's ambassador to Israel -- making it increasingly unlikely that Israel will ever separate itself from that area and increasingly likely that it will become a binational state in which Jews will enjoy rights that Palestinians will be denied.Meanwhile, Trump is increasingly turning America into a banana republic, firing cabinet officials and senior bureaucrats who refuse to carry out his impulsive orders, which are often illegal and mostly related to preventing legal and illegal immigration or asylum requests along the Mexico-United States border. Trump prefers to govern through \"acting'' cabinet secretaries -- he has fired their bosses and not replaced them -- who are much more vulnerable to his whims and more accepting of his more than 10,000 lies and falsehoods since taking office.Bibi, for his part, prefers to simply hold multiple portfolios: For a good chunk of his last term he was prime minister, defense minister, foreign minister and health minister.Both men have no close friends. The one major difference between them is that Bibi is very smart, an avid reader and a deft tactician in managing relations with Israel's neighbors and big powers, such as America, Russia, India and China. Trump is clever but probably has not read a book in years. He gets his information from Fox News and other right-wing media, and rather than playing Vladimir Putin, has been played by him.Both Trump and Netanyahu are being investigated for serious financial improprieties. Israel's attorney general has recommended that Netanyahu be indicted on charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust in three corruption cases.Trump has been cleared by the special counsel on charges of collusion with Russia in the 2016 election, but he remains under investigation, as Reuters noted, on \"issues including his businesses and financial dealings, personal conduct, charitable foundation and inaugural committee.'' Five close Trump aides have already admitted to crimes, mostly financial, or been convicted.Neither man is interested in being a leader for all their people. Each has chosen to rule by dividing his people, not uniting them. They each just want to win by 50.01 percent, by using fear of the outsider and drawing cultural or religious distinctions between their citizens to garner just enough votes to squeak by.Bibi's strategy was to demonize Israeli Arabs, and Trump's was to demonize Muslims and Mexicans and immigrants from what he called \"shithole'' countries. Both men have rebuilt their parties around themselves and their personal politics, and both believe that as long as they can hold their bases by stoking enough fear and cultural division, they can win -- and they're willing to sacrifice any values or norms to do so.Neither man is entirely wrong about the world around him. America does have an illegal immigration problem that Democrats have not taken seriously enough. Israel has real enemies like Iran and its proxies. But Israel's external enemies are well deterred. The existential threat to Israel is that it will annex the West Bank with its Palestinian population and look to the world as an apartheidlike South Africa.My critique of both men is that they consistently try to use these real threats for political gain -- to feed fears, rather than to think creatively about how to defuse them. Because for Bibi to think imaginatively about how to separate from the West Bank and for Trump to think creatively about how to defuse our immigration problem with a coherent national strategy would require each to disappoint or confront the extreme ultranationalists who form the core bases of their support. Neither has the courage or the desire to do so.Indeed, Netanyahu has gone so deep into the gutter that in this last election he agreed to partner with a small, racist, anti-Arab Israeli party -- a party so vile that the Israeli Supreme Court barred its leader from running. In response, Netanyahu's allies immediately threatened to gut the Supreme Court if they win. I don't have to tell you where Trump has gone in indulging white supremacists.Bibi will go down in history as the Israeli leader who concretized the distinction between \"Israelis'' and \"Jews,'' noted Bernard Avishai in a smart essay in The New Yorker: \"The menace, Netanyahu has implied, is not just the Arabs but what might be termed Israeliness -- a legal and cultural identity available to any citizen who participates in Hebrew-speaking civil society, including the 20 percent who are Arab.''While Benny Gantz, Bibi's opponent in the recent election, has argued that, broadly defined, \"Israeli identity is increasingly plausible for, among others, young, middle-class Arabs, who accounted for more than 16 percent of students in bachelor's degree programs in 2017,'' that is not Netanyahu's view.\"Netanyahu's version, in contrast,'' Avishai explained, \"is a state essentially reserved for Jews, including those in the diaspora, who can prove their Jewishness by either rabbinical certification or maternal descent -- one that is democratic only in the sense that Jews constitute the majority, the general will of Jews necessarily prevails, and non-Jews are in the state by sufferance, not really by right.''That is why Netanyahu passed the recent Nation-State Law, which stipulated that Israel is \"the national home of the Jewish people, in which it fulfills its natural, cultural, religious and historical right to self-determination.\" However much American Jews -- and traditional, secular American Jewish supporters of Israel -- \"may try to shield Netanyahu, it is increasingly clear that he is at odds with their democratic standards, which are already under assault,'' Avishai concluded. \"American Jews, like Israeli voters, have choices to make.'' Is Israel a state for Jews or for all its citizens?Trump has dabbled in the same kind of tropes. He may not say it explicitly, but his whole worldview, evident from his dog whistles, is that are primarily white Judeo-Christians -- certainly not Muslims -- and that all black or brown immigrants are suspect.Finally, both Trump and Bibi worship only one thing -- raw, naked power, and they are not afraid to exercise it. Bibi is convinced that if Israel is strong militarily, economically and technologically, the world will bend to its will and beat a path to its door. The Palestinians will surrender; the Arabs will deal with Israel under the table; and China, India and Russia will all come to buy Israeli software. And so far he has been right. Bibi is convinced that liberal American Jews are worthless, that they'll soon disappear via intermarriage and that the country's Orthodox Jews and evangelical Christians will be powerful enough to do Israel's bidding in Washington.Trump too has an obsession with raw power; his favorite insult is to call someone \"weak.'' He lives by the credo: Never apologize, no matter how foul your actions or how big your lie. Just stand firm and everyone will eventually bend your way. It has worked for him too. But at what long-term costs for both societies?Trump is replacing the entire logic of American foreign policy since World War II -- that more global integration and stronger global rules and institutions will make for a more prosperous world, and if America pays a little more than others for that we will reap far more benefits because we are the world's biggest economy -- with a philosophy of competitive nationalism.For Trump, all the global institutions built after World War II -- NATO, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the United Nations -- are just tools for small countries to rip off America or stick it to Israel. Trump actually wants the European Union to crack up, because he thinks that if the United States just negotiates with every nation bilaterally, it will be able to impose asymmetrical trade agreements on them.So have no doubts: Four more years of Netanyahu and six more years of Trump won't just change America and Israel. It will change the world -- and not for the better."},
{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/arts/nolde-nazi-exhibition-berlin-merkel.html", "title": "Stripping Away Lies to Expose a Painter's Nazi Past", "authors": "", "contents": "BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said last week that she would be taking down two oil paintings by Emil Nolde, an Expressionist whose work she greatly admires, from the walls of her office. Her decision, widely discussed in German media, was interpreted as a symbolic gesture: a belated official rejection of an artist who yearned for Adolf Hitler's approval and thought that banishing Jews from the country was a good idea.One of the works, \"Breakers,\" from 1936, shows crashing dark green waves against a fiery evening sky; the other, from 1915, depicts a flower garden. The decision to remove them came just a week after Felix Kramer, an art historian and Nolde expert, questioned in a newspaper article whether \"the works of a committed Nazi are appropriate\" in the chancellery.Ms. Merkel said at a news conference last Thursday that she was returning the paintings to their owner, the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, because they were needed for an exhibition in Berlin. The show, \",\" opens at the Hamburger Bahnhof museum on Friday and runs through Sept. 15. It aims to dispel myths surrounding Nolde's career and art in the Third Reich.Since the end of World War II, Nolde has been cherished by a broad public for his radiant landscapes and vibrantly colored flowers. But Nolde's checkered biography has been whitewashed over the decades. Many Germans got to know Nolde as a victim of the Nazis; the exhibition will show that while his art was persecuted, the artist himself was not.The Berlin show is based on new research that only became possible after a change of leadership at the Ada and Emil Nolde Foundation, which the painter created to manage his archive and to run a museum of his work. Christian Ring, who took over in 2013 and is one of the curators of the Berlin exhibition, started to become aware that it had been involved in reputation-laundering during preparations for a 2014 retrospective in Frankfurt.He decided to open the archives, containing some 25,000 documents, to independent experts to conduct an examination of Nolde's life and work under the Nazis. \"It was time to put all our cards on the table,\" Mr. Ring said in an interview.Nolde was an ardent anti-Semite and a fanatical Nazi. Yet he was also condemned by the regime as a \"degenerate\" artist. After World War II, he embellished and dramatized his victimhood, and played down his complicity in his letters and interviews with journalists, and this was the story that caught on.When Hitler came to power in 1933, Nolde was 65 and established as one of the most successful artists of the Weimar Republic, celebrated as a pioneer of \"new German art.\" A swastika banner hung over his home near the Danish border in 1933, and Nolde joined the Nazi party in 1934. He hoped to be appointed an official state artist and had many fans in the upper ranks of the National Socialists. Yet he also faced accusations that his work was \"alien to the people,\" and Hitler hated it, describing him in 1933 as \"that pig Nolde.\"Nolde's work \"The Life of Christ\" was the centerpiece of the infamous 1937 \"Degenerate Art\" exhibition in Munich, mounted by the Nazis to defame and ridicule art considered \"un-German.\" In 1941, the Reich Chamber of Fine Arts imposed a requirement that Nolde had to have any sales or exhibitions authorized.In his memoirs, Nolde exaggerated and misrepresented the ban, saying he had been forbidden to paint at all, and that it was enforced by visits from the Gestapo. He called a series of small-format watercolors he produced toward the end of the war his \"Unpainted Pictures,\" and said they were studies for oil paintings that he had been prohibited from making.These myths took root and grew. After his death in 1956, the Nolde Foundation exhibited the \"Unpainted Pictures\" in a special room at the museum and excised anti-Semitic passages from new editions of his memoirs. In 1963, a book on the \"Unpainted Pictures\" by the eminent German art historian Werner Haftmann falsely claimed that Nolde turned away from Nazism in 1943.But the biggest boost to Nolde's image came with the 1968 publication of Siegfried Lenz's best-selling novel, \"The German Lesson,\" which is still required reading in German schools today. It centers on an artist called Max Ludwig Nansen, widely understood to be based on Nolde, who produces a series he calls \"invisible pictures\" when he is banned from painting by the Nazis.Particularly among the generation that grew up in the 1960s, embittered with their parents for enabling dictatorship and war, Lenz's novel elevated Nolde's \"Unpainted Pictures\" to symbols of heroic artistic resistance against a tyrannical regime. The foundation's museum was flooded with visitors.Until 2013, the Nolde Foundation \"remained wedded to the Nolde legend, the story that had been selling so well,\" said Bernhard Fulda, a Cambridge historian and one of the independent experts who examined the archive. \"In a way, the foundation had started to believe its own propaganda.\"The other expert, Aya Soika, a professor of art history at Bard College Berlin, recalled writing an email to the foundation in 2003, asking whether there were letters in the archive referring to an ugly incident in 1933, when Nolde incorrectly reported the artist Max Pechstein as a Jew to the Propaganda Ministry.The foundation never responded to Ms. Soika's request. But when she finally gained access to the archive in 2013, she discovered a file labeled \"E.N. and Jews.\" The document at the top was her unanswered email.The research by Mr. Fulda and Ms. Soika compelled the foundation to admit, in 2016, to \"errors of judgment in the past.\" Mr. Ring said he intended to digitize the entire archive and make it available online. He has also updated texts in the permanent exhibition at the museum to reflect the new research.Whether Ms. Merkel's decision to hand back her two paintings was motivated by the artist's unsavory past is unclear. Only one was required for the exhibition, but a spokesman told reporters that the chancellor would not take either one back after the show ends. Other paintings will be displayed instead.Mr. Kramer, the art historian who first questioned whether it was appropriate to hang Nolde works in the chancellery, said he thought it was the right decision. \"The chancellor's fast reaction speaks in her favor,\" he said in an interview.But Mr. Fulda wasn't so sure. \"If Angela Merkel had a picture of an eagle sitting on a swastika, we would say 'Whoa, what is going on?' \" he said. \"But with Nolde, it's very much a case of what you do with it. She could say to visitors, 'The German past is a complex one. There is guilt, there is complicity, there is looking away, there is beauty.' \"So perhaps Nolde succeeded in being a quintessentially German artist -- just not in the way he envisaged."}
